After 3 years, I decided to open source my project, this been a great journey with a lot of learning.
Although I think even an idiot can code this shit up easily but this was great learning experience for me.


Stack:
Nodejs
MongoDB
ExpressJS

Angularjs I know angular 1

Here is how it works:

Crawler written in Python - crawl multiple sites and grab information then run through a baby model nltk category for salary and job category
Nodejs and angularjs used for rendering data.

Simple shit - Should have used reactjs for this though but angular2 is tempting
