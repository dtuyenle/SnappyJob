How is that we can equip our young people to meet the competition that will be coming in the course of their lives, or already coming from... China or Brazil and all the fast growing economies around the world,\u201D he said.\u00A0 \nOakden added that \u201Cthere is something like 80,000 engineers in the universities in Jordan... and if by any chance the Red-Dead Canal \u2014 the canal connecting the Red Sea with the Dead Sea \u2014 were to be built tomorrow, there will be no welders apart from Saif to make it, there are not enough welders in Jordan.\u201D \nDelivering the opening speech, Stetieh said the first phase of the Tariqi Programme focused on the retail sector and was conducted in partnership with the PIT. \nSeveral graduates from the programme also delivered short speeches on their experience during the workshops in regard to content and teaching methods, which they said helped them gain real-life experience that prepared them to join the labour market.\u00A0 \nCaitlin Kennedy, development director of PIT, said \u201CPIT is a relatively young organisation building on 40 years of experience of Prince\u2019s Trust in the UK, created by His Royal Highness Prince of Wales [Charles] in order to help tackle the unemployment and disengagement of young people in the UK.\u201D \nShe added that several programmes which have been running for 10 years in the UK were translated into Tariqi in Jordan, coming from \u201Cthe insight of the need to prepare young people\u201D for professional life. ...",
