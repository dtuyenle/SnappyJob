More >> By MICHAEL LIEDTKEAP Technology Writer \nSAN FRANCISCO (AP) - Bill Campbell, a former Ivy League football coach who became a management guru for Apple co-founder Steve Jobs and other Silicon Valley luminaries, has died. He was 75. \nHis death Monday was confirmed by Kleiner Perkins Caufield Byers, a venture capital firm that often called upon Campbell to help mold entrepreneurs as they tried to manage the rapid growth often triggered by their innovations. Campbell died after a long battle with cancer, according to the firm, which was speaking on behalf of his family. \nAlthough he wasn't widely known outside Silicon Valley, Campbell played a pivotal role in shaping the direction of both Apple and Google, two of the world's most powerful companies. \nAfter working in marketing and sales at Apple during the 1980s, Campbell joined the company's board in 1997, shortly after Jobs returned as the company's CEO. \nAt the time, Apple was flirting with bankruptcy. Campbell frequently served as Jobs' sounding board during one of the most resounding corporate turnarounds in U.S. history as Apple first redesigned its Mac computer line and then rolled out the iPod, iPhone and iPad to emerge as the world most valuable company. Campbell ended his 17-year stint on Apple's board in 2014. \nCampbell \"believed in Apple when few people did and his contributions to our company, through good times and bad, cannot be overstated,\" Apple said in a Monday statement. \nWhile working with Apple, Campbell played a behind-the-scenes role in Google's success, too. Prompted by Kleiner Perkins, Campbell worked with former Google CEO Eric Schmidt and company co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin to help them work out their early differences and eventually forge one of the most successful partnerships in corporate America. \nAlphabet, Google's corporate parent, is now the world's second most valuable company, ranking only behind Apple. \nIn a Facebook post, Schmidt credited Campbell for helping to build Google's culture and hailed his contributions to the company as \"incalculable.\" \n\"We started with him as an external coach but he quickly became the internal management expert,\" Schmidt wrote. \nCampbell stopped consulting with Google in 2010, citing the conflicts of interest that faced him as an Apple board member. Google makes the Android operating system that powers most of the products competing against Apple's trendsetting iPhone and iPad. \nCampbell's background gave little inkling he would become one of Silicon Valley's most influential figures. \nBefore joining Apple, Campbell spent six seasons as the head coach of Columbia University's football team. He compiled a 12-41-1 record at Columbia, a .231 winning percentage that was more than double that of his three successors. \nAs a student at Columbia, Campbell was the captain and an offensive guard on the football team that went 6-3 in 1961, including a 6-1 record in the Ivy League that earned the university a share of the conference title with Harvard. It's still the only time that Columbia's football team won the Ivy League. \nEven after he left football, Campbell remained known as \"Coach\" in Silicon Valley. He also owned an interest in a sports bar in Palo Alto, California, where he regularly met with friends and colleagues at a table with a brass plaque inscribed \"Coach's Corner.\" \nBefore becoming a mentor to other companies, Campbell was CEO of software maker Intuit Inc. from 1994 to 1998. He later served as that company's chairman until stepping down earlier this year. \n___ \nAssociated Press writer Ronald Blum in New York contributed to this story.

      "text": "College Job Site WayUp Releases New Recruiting Tool with Advanced Targeting PRWeb \nWayUp, the largest online marketplace exclusively for college students to find jobs and internships, launches a new search function to help employers hire targeted, diverse candidates in record time. NEW YORK, NY (PRWEB) April 18, 2016 \nWayUp, the largest online marketplace exclusively for college students to find jobs and internships, announced today at the ASU GSV Summit the launch of a new, highly functional “search for students” feature that businesses can use. This new function addresses employers’ inability to efficiently search and target diverse student applicants, making WayUp the most effective tool for both sides of the job search equation. \nFocused on helping employers find and engage quality students, WayUp now offers a smart-search function that allows companies to purposefully and effectively dive into WayUp’s student base, comprised of nearly half a million college students, 72% of which account for underrepresented minorities at over 3,300 campuses throughout the US. Out of these campuses, 50% of students on the site attend top universities like Princeton and Columbia University. These student users are actively on the job search, hoping to be contacted by employers. Employers can already use certain filters to draw students to their listing, but now they can also select students based on detailed criteria such as major, hobbies, coding abilities, GPA, school, and much more. Once a business sees a student’s profile that they are interested in, they can invite them to apply (specifically, those students who make themselves ‘searchable’, which is currently over 80% of users). Employers will now be able to expand and diversify their typical search virtually, within a matter of seconds. \n“We’ve reimagined the way businesses may want to look for students. Career fairs are a hard place for a business to pick out all-stars. So now, we’re excited to be bringing the human element back to the online job search,” says Xiao Lin, Software Engineer at WayUp and lead dev on this new function. “There is an emotional part of the hiring process that had been lost. With the new search function, you can go beyond GPA and school, encouraging employers to get creative with the hiring search. They’re able to add incredible color to their applicant pool by searching for hobbies, fun facts, key skills and more. Meanwhile, students are able to use fun profiles, that include things like fun facts about themselves.” \nIn short, WayUp’s new search function not only increases efficiency for employers, but also adds a sense of each applicant’s personality, coupled with objective and essential data for hiring. \nKey functions of the search include: Auto-populated filters include: Degree, campus, major, student type, graduation year, GPA, resume, car on campus, greek life, and involvement in sports team. Ability to search across 3,300 campuses at once. Strong performance: speed and depth (student profiles are instantaneously updated and employers can review up to 20 in-depth profiles in under 2 minutes). A “smart search bar” will allow users to freely type without having to worry about cumbersome checkboxes and dropdowns. -Start simple with a campus name, or, get more complex by adding targeted keywords like \"nyu yoga sales\", and thousands of NYU students will appear Student name and contact information are kept private until they have applied. \nAbout WayUp \nWayUp, the largest online marketplace exclusively for U.S. college students looking for part-time jobs, summer internships, virtual gigs and full-time jobs upon graduation. Launched in September 2014, WayUp is the only site where employers can post a job to a targeted (and filtered) audience of students at any US college. WayUp has nearly half a million college students across 3,300 campuses in the US. They currently work with upwards of 8,500 employers and have over a million jobs live on the site. Both side of the marketplace are working together, as 1 out of every 3 students who applies to a job on WayUp, get hired. \n### \nFor the original version on PRWeb visit: http://www.prweb.com/releases/2016/04/prweb13349924.htm Main menu",

Most of the affected workers will be notified in the next 60 days. \nIntel said the cuts will provide about $1.4 billion in annual savings by the time the cuts are completed next year. \nThe company, based in Santa Clara, California, is a leading supplier of computer chips, but PC sales have been declining steadily in recent years. It's trying to focus on its most profitable lines of business, which include making processors for data center computers and Internet-connected gadgets. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

      "text": "Find on Facebook Posted April 19, 2016, at 8:53 p.m. \nBIDDEFORD, Maine — Gov. Paul LePage upped his estimate of how many jobs will be lost in Maine in the coming months to as many as 1,500. \nLePage’s comments, made during a public town hall meeting Tuesday at Biddeford High School, came about two weeks after he generated days of headlines by claiming a southern Maine company was about to shed 900 jobs . LePage later clarified that it would be two companies. He didn’t provide any new details Tuesday other than the higher number. \n“This summer, we’re going to lose between 1,200 and 1,500 more jobs,” LePage told a crowd of about 80. “Every single job we’re talking about are jobs that get paid above the per-capita median.” \nThe comment came as LePage broke from his previous pattern at his town halls and opened Tuesday’s meeting with his assessment of the legislative session that is near its end . Barring a special session, the Legislature will return for one more day on April 29 to vote whether to sustain however many vetoes LePage signs between now and then. \n“Now that the Legislature is out of session I can tell you some areas where the Legislature took some action and some areas they did not,” he said. \nLePage applauded lawmakers for enacting a welfare reform bill that limits how public cash benefits can be used and for a bill that will help ease student debt, but was highly critical of an overhaul of Maine’s solar energy plan and a bill that would provide raises to workers at Maine’s two state-run mental hospitals. \nLePage spent much of the event bemoaning Maine’s energy costs and alleging that the solar bill would increase electricity bills for all Mainers. However, LePage indicated that there may be hope for the bill. \n“I’ve invited the Democrats to come in on Friday to see if they can understand where I’m coming from, but the likelihood is it’s going to get vetoed and the veto will be sustained,” said LePage. \nAs with the rest of his town halls — which LePage said he is doing to circumvent the media and speak directly to the Maine people — the governor ranged between numerous topics in response to questions from the audience. He cited numerous data and statistics, some incorrectly, such as saying twice that Maine’s biennial state budget is $7.4 billion (it’s $6.7 billion) and he appeared to seriously understate the number of millionaires in Maine while trying to make a point that Maine’s tax burden has driven them away. \n“Twenty-five years ago, Maine had the same number of millionaires as New Hampshire and about the same population,” he said. “We were both at about 2,500. Now we’re down to 500 and New Hampshire is up over 5,000. They appreciate success. We don’t.” \nThere are numerous organizations that count millionaires, most of which have much higher number than those cited by LePage. According to the Bangor Daily News archives, there were more than 26,000 millionaire Mainers in 2013 . The website NetState.com had a lower number: 22,218 in 2006, which indicates the number of millionaires in the Pine Tree State is growing. The site said New Hampshire had about 26,500 millionaires in 2006. \nLePage spent a considerable amount of time on education and his argument that Maine spends too much on public schools for the results, which LePage repeatedly has said are dismal compared with other states. He said Maine teachers need to be paid more and that they need to operate more as “mentors” to students, instead of instructors. \nA bill to raise the minimum teacher salary in Maine to $40,000 a year and provide more training and mentorship in the classroom failed earlier this month in the Legislature. \nIn response to a question about disruptive students, LePage suggested Maine classrooms need more discipline but he didn’t elaborate. \n“The state of Maine has decided that we don’t need discipline in our schools,” he said. “That was a big mistake. … There’s a lot that can be done but it has got to start with discipline.” \nAs with many of LePage’s town halls, there were two hecklers, including one who has attended several and been asked to leave. It caused LePage to compare himself to the rock band the Grateful Dead. \n“The Grateful Dead had a lot of people who followed them around called groupies,” said LePage. “I have two groupies here tonight. I might have even more.” \nThat caused one of the hecklers to storm out of the room. \n“The moment you compare yourself to Jerry Garcia and the Grateful Dead, I’ve got to get out of here,” he yelled.",

      "text": "Home / Abuja Metro / We spent millions of naira on recruitment –Victims of federal civil service job scam We spent millions of naira on recruitment –Victims of federal civil service job scam — 20th April 2016 \n…Accuse trainers of sexual harassment \nBy ROMANUS UGWU \nWhen Bayelsa State-born Ekpere Precious applied for and secured enlistment in Nigeria Immigration Service (NIS) last year, his joy knew no bounds. Confident of better life ahead, he was happy to miss his former job as an accountant in a secondary school. \nBut eight months down the line after going through all the rudimentary and professional training as Immigration personnel alongside 2, 000 others, Precious has realised rather too late that his supposed new job was a fluke afterall, because it never existed in the first place! Obviously, his decision to leave his former employment for the phantom immigration job was his worst in life. \nToday, Precious has not only lost his former job, he has failed to be formally enrolled in the Immigration job after he was trained and exposed to the professional secrets of the profession, including arms handling. \nNarrating the ordeal of the 2, 000 trained recruits during a peaceful protest at the supposed Ministry of Interior in Abuja recently, he said: “We were recruited by the Ministry of Interior for the Immigration Service on May 22, 2015, and sent to our various state commands where we underwent three-month induction training. \n“The induction involved mainly intense military drills, physical exercise and aggressive courses on immigration duties, police duties, border patrol, arms/weapon handling, ECOWAS surveillance and investigation, passport, CERPAC and security awareness among other courses relevant to the operations of the Immigration Service. \n“To our dismay, a memo was received from the supposed service headquarters on August 20, 2015 directing that the recruits be dispersed forthwith. It is important to note that during the period of the induction, these recruits were made to buy Service shoes, uniforms and other accoutrements without any allowance/salary. \n“Most of us left our previous jobs to join the Immigration. For example, I had to resign my job and forfeit the official accommodation provided to me as an accountant in a big school in Bayelsa State. I had to relocate my family and because of the finance involved in the training, I had to sell most of my property. \n“Three months after our induction training, sadly, the circular to disperse us forthwith without any official explanation on why we were directed to go home, came in August last year. We have been at home for over eight months now with uncertainty. Painfully, we have heard that there is currently a replacement going in the Immigration and that close to 2,000 recruits are currently undergoing training at Immigration training schools across the federation. \n“In naira and kobo, the estimate of what I have spent so far, right from the time we were recruited till date is more than N500,000. After the Computer-Based Test (CBT), we had to travel to Kano for induction and stayed in an hotel for days. \n“I regret everything now because I was initially very reluctant to apply for the job because of the situation of things in the country, but someone practically forced me to enlist and funny enough, I received a notification for the test, went through the process and was very surprised with the transparency of the whole exercise. A reputable organisation conducted the exercise. My life has been turned upside down with the situation I found myself now.” \nSame situation in Federal Task Force \nLike Ekpere, Mr. Adelokiki Pius was not only a happily married man, but had a booming business until January 2013, when the urge to enjoy a piece of the national cake as a federal civil servant made him to join the Federal Task Force. \nAccording to Adelokiki, that singular decision has ruined his business and marriage as his wife has since abandoned him. Adelokiki and 51,000 other colleagues recruited as Federal Task Force personnel by the Federal Government during the Jonathan administration have been thrown into a life of uncertainty and hopelessness. \nNarrating their sad experiences, the Federal Task Force trainees, who stormed the National Assembly to protest what they have passed through since the training started in 2013, passionately appealed to the Presidency to offset their accumulated training allowances and salaries put at N4.03 billion. \nThe trainees complained that each of the 51,000 members spent between N70,000 and N1 million to obtain the recruitment forms, buy the kits and undergo the requisite training. \nThey alleged all manner of maltreatment during their recruitment and training, including extortion, sexual molestation and abuse of ladies and married women, adding that despite paying as high as N20,000 each to collect their employment letters, they were dispersed with teargases on returning from the break to resume duties. \nMode of recruitment and training \nAdelokiki stated that their training started in Furo, Lagos on January 7, 2013 with 13,000 trainees. He said: “We trained on white outfits, but we started suspecting the authenticity of the programme when the number of trainees rose to 51,000 across the federation. Some of us got the recruitment application forms from the house of a prominent politician in Lagos while others got theirs at FERMA office in Lagos. While some paid N80,000, others spent as high as N200,000 to N300,000 to get the forms. \n“But, the women paid less for the recruitment forms, especially those ladies ready to sacrifice their body. They gave the forms free of charge to beautiful ladies and some married women who were willing to have sex with them in exchange. \n“To confirm the immoralities, the training grounds were littered with used condoms every morning we came out for training. There was a lady with us here called Promise (other name withheld by Abuja Metro ). They stripped her naked because she refused their sexual advances. I served three days punishment for rescuing her from their harassment. We passed through hell in their hands during the training.” \nHe recalled that in an apparent move to discourage suspicion, the organisers came to Lagos from Abuja with newspaper cuttings of where then President Jonathan endorsed the training and agreed to pay their salaries and allowances. \n“Such reports would boost our morale and keep us going, but little did we know that they were playing on our intelligence. When they promised us N150,000 training allowance and N50,000 monthly salaries, many of us even went the extra mile, borrowing to pay the charges they kept levying us. Surprisingly, they told us to go home on January 15, 2015 to get our voters cards ready for the general elections. \n“Before discharging us after the training, they issued us employment letters and compelled us to pay N20,000 to collect them. I sold my telephone and many other personal belongings to raise money to collect my appointment letter, with the excitement of becoming an employee of Federal Government. \n“However, on our return to get our postings and assume duty, they turned us back at the gate, denying knowing us at all. They unleashed mobile policemen on us, who beat and dispersed us with teargas. Many of us sustained injuries while they were trying to disperse us from the training venue. As I speak with you, I cannot see with my left eye due to the teargas canister they shot at me. I have really spent so such to treat my eye, without anybody caring to ask me how I am coping; yet, I cannot see with it. \n“That was the painful story of how we were recruited and abandoned after training for two years, without salary and/ or allowances. We have been to Abuja on protest thrice because as patriotic citizens, we do not want to be an instrument of terror and violence.” \nJob specification \nAccording to the protesters, the initial agreement was that they would be deployed in various local government areas for specific jobs, including recovery of abandoned Federal Government property, monitoring the waterways, control of traffic and protection of telecommunication installations. It was gathered that the task force had the potentialities to generate at least N320 billion annually into the federal coffers. \nMany died of hopelessness \nAdelokiki said: “On realising that we have been defrauded of N4.29 million, the amount we paid for obtaining recruitment forms, medical test, buying of uniforms, training kits and hiring of offices in our local governments, many of our members died out of hopelessness. \n“At a time, we lost count of the number of casualties recorded. More than 15 persons died during the training. Many of us abandoned our businesses and means of livelihood, sold off our belongings to meet up with the financial requirements of the trainings. Some homes have been broken today and the wives of many us had left them. My wife left me in 2014 because like many others, I could no longer bear my financial responsibilities. At least, three of our members are suffering depression and mental disorder.” \nDemands from Federal Government \nAdelokiki said he and his colleagues want the confirmation of the appointment letters issued to us, while the Federal Government should investigate the allegation of extortion against those involved in the phantom recruitment. \n“More importantly, we demand that the three years outstanding salaries, our training allowances and other incentives be paid to all the 51,000 people that participated in the training all over the federation, including the dead. Also, we demand that certain abandoned Federal Government offices be released to us to serve as our operational base. Some of them are NITEL, office at old Otta Road in Agege, the abandoned NDLEA office in Oshodi, Federal Ministry of Works Training School in Badagry and the abandoned FERMA ground at Ijora, all in Lagos and other such offices in all the states”, he said. \nYour email address will not be published.

      "text": "Apr 20, 2016 07:04 AM EDT By Mariel Hemingway   Contractual Early Career Academics Staff Trending In Higher Education Jobs [VIDEO] University and College Union released a report that fixed-term or contractual employment is a trend among early career academics.(Photo : Johannes Simon/Getty Images) \nA report published by the University of College Union (UCU) reveals that contractual employment among early career academics are rampant among colleges universities. It claims that more than 50 percent of higher teaching staff is employed on fixed-term contracts. However, the report says that the numbers may be higher than that and that it is becoming a norm in higher education careers. Like Us on Facebook \nThe study titled \" Precarious Work in Higher Education: A Snapshot of Insecure Contracts and Institutional Attitudes \" measures how many junior academics are working with insecure contracts. The report states that nearly half of academic teaching staff and more than half of academic staff or on contractual employment. This suggests that UK university students may be taught under the care of a teacher with fixed-term contracts. This could affect students in the long run as teachers in contractual employment may feel insecure working their jobs and thus cannot deliver the highest standard of service. 'Fixed term contracts now the norm for early career academics' says new UCU report https://t.co/eGGeH4ur8W \n— Jack Grove (@jgro_the) April 14, 2016 \nVicky Blake, a PhD student working at Durham University shares that her teaching stint does not give her a livable wage. She has to hold down part-time positions at different universities to make ends meet as there is no guarantee that she can get a new contract for her academic job, The Guardian reports. \n\"I have to put a time limit on how long I can hold out for a proper research job, and I think that's really sad,\" Blake told the outlet. Additionally, Blake is one of the lucky ones because one of her part-time stints at a university earned her another job. \nAccording to Times Higher Education , the report by UCU is an ongoing issue that has not been tackled by universities. Some universities reportedly claim that their teaching staff enjoys the flexibility that comes with contractual employment. The UCU called out the unavailability of university data regarding their employed teaching staff. It makes it hard for them to determine the actual figure of how many junior academics are on fixed-term contracts. \nHowever, Universities and Colleges Employers Association (Ucea) says that the Hesa data they gathered say that a quarter of teaching staff in UK universities are on open-ended contracts. Those with contractual employment are actually paid students. \nWhat do you think of fixed-term contracts in higher education jobs? Do you think the issue is bigger than it is?

      "text": "April 20, 2016 12:20 PM I used to be a flight attendant. Dealing with passengers' racism is part of the job. \nFlight attendants often must referee when people with wildly different life experiences are crammed into an aircraft cabin \nSometimes you're asked to be someone's accomplice -- in their racism, their homophobia, their cruel joke Flight attendants are trained extensively in evaluating suspicious behavior. Donna McWilliam AP i Order Reprint of this Story \nIt was during the boarding process on a flight from Fort Lauderdale to JFK in the fall of 2009. I had long since learned the key to a pleasant flight was to greet everyone as they boarded, so I stood in the front galley and said my hellos. \nSuddenly a middle-aged white woman leaned uncomfortably close to me and whispered, \"There is man, four people behind me, in a green shirt, who is very suspicious.\" \nI whispered back, \"OK. What's he doing?\" \n\"You'll see,\" she said, wide-eyed. \nI thought two things: This woman is probably racist. And I need to take her seriously. \nAs a former flight attendant for a major carrier, I'm not surprised to hear that a Southwest Airlines passenger reported UC Berkeley student Khairuldeen Makhzoomi as suspicious after he said \"Inshallah\" (\"God willing\" in Arabic) during a phone call. Flight attendants are often made to play referee when hundreds of humans with wildly different life experiences are crammed into an aircraft cabin. \nIt's usually simple stuff, like moving the man with the severe dog allergy as far away as possible from the blind woman's service animal. Or asking the bachelor party to pipe down for the umpteenth time, because not everyone is going to Las Vegas to get drunk. \nFlight attendants are trained extensively in evaluating suspicious behavior. The training infuses you with an automatic paranoid vigilance that follows you forever and insists you take all threats seriously, since the cost of being wrong is too high. But nowhere does it recommend you accept a passenger's assessment of a situation, and nowhere does it teach that speaking Arabic is cause for suspicion. \nBut sometimes you're asked to be someone's accomplice -- in their racism, their homophobia, their cruel joke about the larger person seated next to them or their conviction that the mother in front of them should drug her child to shut him up. For professionals who are supposed to be polite, it can get awkward. \nOn the Southwest flight, Makhzoomi, after boarding and taking his seat, phoned an uncle and was speaking to him in Arabic. He told The Washington Post that he cut the call short after noticing that the woman seated in front of him had turned to stare. She left her seat, and soon afterward a Southwest employee told him he had to get off the plane. Makhzoomi complied. After being questioned by police officers and FBI agents, he eventually was released but was told he could not fly Southwest. He arrived home, he said, nine hours after his initial arrival time, on Delta Air Lines. \nSince Southwest has declined to explain its perspective, we have only Makhzoomi's account of what happened to go on. But if it's true that the flight attendant had no other interaction with him from the time the other passenger reported him to the time he was pulled off the plane - well, that shocks me. \nFlight attendants are trained extensively in evaluating suspicious behavior with videos, checklists, quizzes and drills. (And drills and drills and drills.) The training infuses you with an automatic paranoid vigilance that follows you forever and insists you take all threats seriously, since the cost of being wrong is too high. But nowhere does it recommend you accept a passenger's assessment of a situation, and nowhere does it teach that speaking Arabic is cause for suspicion. \nBefore that 2009 flight, after the woman alerted me to the \"suspicious\" passenger, I thanked her and told her I'd check him out. I watched the man closely as he stepped onto the plane, looking for signs of a terrorist. Was he jittery? Nope. Was he sweating? A little bit, but we were in South Florida; I was sweating, too. Was he wearing unseasonable clothing, like a big coat in the summertime? No. In fact, his Green Bay Packers jersey perfectly fit the season -- football season. \nDid he have trouble following a normal conversation? \n\"Hi, how're you doing today?\" I asked. \n\"Fine,\" he said, nodding casually. \n\"Going home?\" I asked. \n\"Nope, wedding,\" he said. \nAll right, no problems there. \nA few minutes later, after he'd reached his seat, I walked down the aisle to assess again, the woman who flagged him tracking me with her eyes. \nDid he hold on tightly to a piece of luggage? No, his carry-on was in the overhead bin. Did he sit stiffly? No, he was slouched in his seat, headphones on, already watching the game on the seatback TV. Not exactly the actions of person who believes he's about to die. \nThe only thing he appeared to have in common with the 9/11 hijackers was that he was brown. He could have been Punjabi or Puerto Rican. He could have been Catholic, or Sikh, or one of the many hundreds of millions of Muslims who have nothing to do with terrorism. I let it go and had no further discussion with the man or the woman, other than to serve them drinks and bid them well when they disembarked at JFK. I hope, and I think it's likely, that the man never noticed what was happening. \nI grew up in a wealthy, mostly white, mostly Mormon town out West. Respect for God's will for us was a frequent topic of conversation among my friends. And, like lots of future pilots and flight attendants, my favorite toy was the globe. I'd spin and spin it, dreaming of all the different, \"exotic\" places I'd go. Becoming a flight attendant made my dreams come true. That has included travel to Muslim-majority countries, where the frequent incantation of \"God willing\" quite frankly reminds me of home. \nSouthwest has a reputation for friendly customer service. I know Southwest flight attendants, and even in the relative privacy of their Facebook feeds, they talk of genuinely loving their passengers and the work they do to keep them safe and comfortable. \nWhen passengers reported an issue, we didn't know what their life experience was. That's why it was so important that we made assessments based on training. In this case, being friendly and being vigilant should have called for the same thing: a conversation. Anyone who makes a snap judgment from the cocoon of the galley has no business being a flight attendant. \nGillian Brockell is a video editor at The Washington Post. Related content",

      "text": "April 20, 2016 11:20 AM I used to be a flight attendant. Dealing with passengers' racism is part of the job. \nFlight attendants often must referee when people with wildly different life experiences are crammed into an aircraft cabin \nSometimes you're asked to be someone's accomplice -- in their racism, their homophobia, their cruel joke Flight attendants are trained extensively in evaluating suspicious behavior. Donna McWilliam AP i Order Reprint of this Story \nIt was during the boarding process on a flight from Fort Lauderdale to JFK in the fall of 2009. I had long since learned the key to a pleasant flight was to greet everyone as they boarded, so I stood in the front galley and said my hellos. \nSuddenly a middle-aged white woman leaned uncomfortably close to me and whispered, \"There is man, four people behind me, in a green shirt, who is very suspicious.\" \nI whispered back, \"OK. What's he doing?\" \n\"You'll see,\" she said, wide-eyed. \nI thought two things: This woman is probably racist. And I need to take her seriously. \nAs a former flight attendant for a major carrier, I'm not surprised to hear that a Southwest Airlines passenger reported UC Berkeley student Khairuldeen Makhzoomi as suspicious after he said \"Inshallah\" (\"God willing\" in Arabic) during a phone call. Flight attendants are often made to play referee when hundreds of humans with wildly different life experiences are crammed into an aircraft cabin. \nIt's usually simple stuff, like moving the man with the severe dog allergy as far away as possible from the blind woman's service animal. Or asking the bachelor party to pipe down for the umpteenth time, because not everyone is going to Las Vegas to get drunk. \nFlight attendants are trained extensively in evaluating suspicious behavior. The training infuses you with an automatic paranoid vigilance that follows you forever and insists you take all threats seriously, since the cost of being wrong is too high. But nowhere does it recommend you accept a passenger's assessment of a situation, and nowhere does it teach that speaking Arabic is cause for suspicion. \nBut sometimes you're asked to be someone's accomplice -- in their racism, their homophobia, their cruel joke about the larger person seated next to them or their conviction that the mother in front of them should drug her child to shut him up. For professionals who are supposed to be polite, it can get awkward. \nOn the Southwest flight, Makhzoomi, after boarding and taking his seat, phoned an uncle and was speaking to him in Arabic. He told The Washington Post that he cut the call short after noticing that the woman seated in front of him had turned to stare. She left her seat, and soon afterward a Southwest employee told him he had to get off the plane. Makhzoomi complied. After being questioned by police officers and FBI agents, he eventually was released but was told he could not fly Southwest. He arrived home, he said, nine hours after his initial arrival time, on Delta Air Lines. \nSince Southwest has declined to explain its perspective, we have only Makhzoomi's account of what happened to go on. But if it's true that the flight attendant had no other interaction with him from the time the other passenger reported him to the time he was pulled off the plane - well, that shocks me. \nFlight attendants are trained extensively in evaluating suspicious behavior with videos, checklists, quizzes and drills. (And drills and drills and drills.) The training infuses you with an automatic paranoid vigilance that follows you forever and insists you take all threats seriously, since the cost of being wrong is too high. But nowhere does it recommend you accept a passenger's assessment of a situation, and nowhere does it teach that speaking Arabic is cause for suspicion. \nBefore that 2009 flight, after the woman alerted me to the \"suspicious\" passenger, I thanked her and told her I'd check him out. I watched the man closely as he stepped onto the plane, looking for signs of a terrorist. Was he jittery? Nope. Was he sweating? A little bit, but we were in South Florida; I was sweating, too. Was he wearing unseasonable clothing, like a big coat in the summertime? No. In fact, his Green Bay Packers jersey perfectly fit the season -- football season. \nDid he have trouble following a normal conversation? \n\"Hi, how're you doing today?\" I asked. \n\"Fine,\" he said, nodding casually. \n\"Going home?\" I asked. \n\"Nope, wedding,\" he said. \nAll right, no problems there. \nA few minutes later, after he'd reached his seat, I walked down the aisle to assess again, the woman who flagged him tracking me with her eyes. \nDid he hold on tightly to a piece of luggage? No, his carry-on was in the overhead bin. Did he sit stiffly? No, he was slouched in his seat, headphones on, already watching the game on the seatback TV. Not exactly the actions of person who believes he's about to die. \nThe only thing he appeared to have in common with the 9/11 hijackers was that he was brown. He could have been Punjabi or Puerto Rican. He could have been Catholic, or Sikh, or one of the many hundreds of millions of Muslims who have nothing to do with terrorism. I let it go and had no further discussion with the man or the woman, other than to serve them drinks and bid them well when they disembarked at JFK. I hope, and I think it's likely, that the man never noticed what was happening. \nI grew up in a wealthy, mostly white, mostly Mormon town out West. Respect for God's will for us was a frequent topic of conversation among my friends. And, like lots of future pilots and flight attendants, my favorite toy was the globe. I'd spin and spin it, dreaming of all the different, \"exotic\" places I'd go. Becoming a flight attendant made my dreams come true. That has included travel to Muslim-majority countries, where the frequent incantation of \"God willing\" quite frankly reminds me of home. \nSouthwest has a reputation for friendly customer service. I know Southwest flight attendants, and even in the relative privacy of their Facebook feeds, they talk of genuinely loving their passengers and the work they do to keep them safe and comfortable. \nWhen passengers reported an issue, we didn't know what their life experience was. That's why it was so important that we made assessments based on training. In this case, being friendly and being vigilant should have called for the same thing: a conversation. Anyone who makes a snap judgment from the cocoon of the galley has no business being a flight attendant. \nGillian Brockell is a video editor at The Washington Post. Related content",

      "text": "April 20, 2016 12:20 PM I used to be a flight attendant. Dealing with passengers' racism is part of the job. \nFlight attendants often must referee when people with wildly different life experiences are crammed into an aircraft cabin \nSometimes you're asked to be someone's accomplice -- in their racism, their homophobia, their cruel joke Flight attendants are trained extensively in evaluating suspicious behavior. Donna McWilliam AP i Order Reprint of this Story \nIt was during the boarding process on a flight from Fort Lauderdale to JFK in the fall of 2009. I had long since learned the key to a pleasant flight was to greet everyone as they boarded, so I stood in the front galley and said my hellos. \nSuddenly a middle-aged white woman leaned uncomfortably close to me and whispered, \"There is man, four people behind me, in a green shirt, who is very suspicious.\" \nI whispered back, \"OK. What's he doing?\" \n\"You'll see,\" she said, wide-eyed. \nI thought two things: This woman is probably racist. And I need to take her seriously. \nAs a former flight attendant for a major carrier, I'm not surprised to hear that a Southwest Airlines passenger reported UC Berkeley student Khairuldeen Makhzoomi as suspicious after he said \"Inshallah\" (\"God willing\" in Arabic) during a phone call. Flight attendants are often made to play referee when hundreds of humans with wildly different life experiences are crammed into an aircraft cabin. \nIt's usually simple stuff, like moving the man with the severe dog allergy as far away as possible from the blind woman's service animal. Or asking the bachelor party to pipe down for the umpteenth time, because not everyone is going to Las Vegas to get drunk. \nFlight attendants are trained extensively in evaluating suspicious behavior. The training infuses you with an automatic paranoid vigilance that follows you forever and insists you take all threats seriously, since the cost of being wrong is too high. But nowhere does it recommend you accept a passenger's assessment of a situation, and nowhere does it teach that speaking Arabic is cause for suspicion. \nBut sometimes you're asked to be someone's accomplice -- in their racism, their homophobia, their cruel joke about the larger person seated next to them or their conviction that the mother in front of them should drug her child to shut him up. For professionals who are supposed to be polite, it can get awkward. \nOn the Southwest flight, Makhzoomi, after boarding and taking his seat, phoned an uncle and was speaking to him in Arabic. He told The Washington Post that he cut the call short after noticing that the woman seated in front of him had turned to stare. She left her seat, and soon afterward a Southwest employee told him he had to get off the plane. Makhzoomi complied. After being questioned by police officers and FBI agents, he eventually was released but was told he could not fly Southwest. He arrived home, he said, nine hours after his initial arrival time, on Delta Air Lines. \nSince Southwest has declined to explain its perspective, we have only Makhzoomi's account of what happened to go on. But if it's true that the flight attendant had no other interaction with him from the time the other passenger reported him to the time he was pulled off the plane - well, that shocks me. \nFlight attendants are trained extensively in evaluating suspicious behavior with videos, checklists, quizzes and drills. (And drills and drills and drills.) The training infuses you with an automatic paranoid vigilance that follows you forever and insists you take all threats seriously, since the cost of being wrong is too high. But nowhere does it recommend you accept a passenger's assessment of a situation, and nowhere does it teach that speaking Arabic is cause for suspicion. \nBefore that 2009 flight, after the woman alerted me to the \"suspicious\" passenger, I thanked her and told her I'd check him out. I watched the man closely as he stepped onto the plane, looking for signs of a terrorist. Was he jittery? Nope. Was he sweating? A little bit, but we were in South Florida; I was sweating, too. Was he wearing unseasonable clothing, like a big coat in the summertime? No. In fact, his Green Bay Packers jersey perfectly fit the season -- football season. \nDid he have trouble following a normal conversation? \n\"Hi, how're you doing today?\" I asked. \n\"Fine,\" he said, nodding casually. \n\"Going home?\" I asked. \n\"Nope, wedding,\" he said. \nAll right, no problems there. \nA few minutes later, after he'd reached his seat, I walked down the aisle to assess again, the woman who flagged him tracking me with her eyes. \nDid he hold on tightly to a piece of luggage? No, his carry-on was in the overhead bin. Did he sit stiffly? No, he was slouched in his seat, headphones on, already watching the game on the seatback TV. Not exactly the actions of person who believes he's about to die. \nThe only thing he appeared to have in common with the 9/11 hijackers was that he was brown. He could have been Punjabi or Puerto Rican. He could have been Catholic, or Sikh, or one of the many hundreds of millions of Muslims who have nothing to do with terrorism. I let it go and had no further discussion with the man or the woman, other than to serve them drinks and bid them well when they disembarked at JFK. I hope, and I think it's likely, that the man never noticed what was happening. \nI grew up in a wealthy, mostly white, mostly Mormon town out West. Respect for God's will for us was a frequent topic of conversation among my friends. And, like lots of future pilots and flight attendants, my favorite toy was the globe. I'd spin and spin it, dreaming of all the different, \"exotic\" places I'd go. Becoming a flight attendant made my dreams come true. That has included travel to Muslim-majority countries, where the frequent incantation of \"God willing\" quite frankly reminds me of home. \nSouthwest has a reputation for friendly customer service.

      "text": "Published April 20, 2016 Realtor.com Email Print loan-want-ads\nWhen Joy and Bryant Wingfield started shopping for a mortgage in 2011, they were turned down left and right. The reason? Bryant didn't have a full-time job, working sporadically as a guard for a security company.\n\"One week, he'd freelance for them, and the next, he wouldn't work at all,\" Joy explains. Although she was working full-time, as a couple they didn't have the steady flow of income that lenders like to see. \"Due to these income fluctuations, we were denied mortgages when we first applied.\"\nIt's a common scenario: One-third of Americans earn their paycheck as Uber/Lyft drivers, freelancers, TaskRabbits, sole business proprietors, eBay sellers, or contract workers. Many of them want to buy a home, but lenders can be leery of extending credit to people who lack full-time employment.\nNonetheless, eventually the Wingfields did manage to nab a $216,000 home loan and purchase a three-bedroom condo in Union City, NJ. So what's their secret -- and how can other home buyers follow in their footsteps? Read on to learn how to land a home loan without full-time work.\nFlaunt your track record\nProve to your would-be lender that the real estate investment you're eyeing is safely within your already established budget.\n\"Say you've been renting for $1,200 a month,\" says Rocke Andrews, president of the National Association of Mortgage Brokers . \"Say your proposed mortgage plus maintenance brings your monthly housing costs to $1,050. Show you've been paying $150 more in rent -- and have been doing so consistently over time.\" Rent stubs -- and a letter from your landlord confirming that you've covered your expenses promptly and in full -- will bolster your case.\nThe same goes for documentation from past and previous lenders. The Wingfields, for instance, provided proof that they had paid their student loans, credit-card bills, insurance invoices, and car payments in full and on time.\n\"Don't just show you have the ability to cover your debts,\" says David Luna , a Salt Lake City mortgage broker and the former commissioner of real estate for the state of Utah. \"Pay ahead of schedule if you can, proving you're willing to make transactions as easy on your lenders as possible.\"\nShow savings\nIn order to qualify for a mortgage, you need to prove not only that you have a steady income and a solid credit history, but a generous nest egg in reserve.\n\"Consider that scenario in which buying a new home would cost you $1,050 per month,\" says Andrews. \"At a minimum, lenders will want to see that you have a reserve of two months' expenses, or $2,100. But ideally, you want to have at least six months' expenses -- or $12,600 -- in assets that you can readily liquidate.\" The bigger your safety net, the greater the chances that potential lenders will let your mortgage application fly.\nValidate your income\n\"At a minimum, you want to show that you've been doing what you do to earn money -- and doing it successfully -- for two solid years running,\" says Andrews. You also want to demonstrate that your income is rising instead of declining.\n\"Aim to show that in 2015, you earned more than you did in 2014, and that in 2014, you earned more than in 2013,\" says Luna. \"Get tax forms and other documents that show your income inching higher and higher for as many years running as possible.\"\nGet a co-signer\nIf you can't land a mortgage on your own, consider asking a family member or business associate to co-sign with you. As a freelancer or contract worker, do you have employers with whom you've developed longstanding relationships? Enlist them to help your case. Submit contracts showing you have guaranteed work from them in the future (noting that the longer those contracts stand, the better).\n\"Also get letters from them stating that you're reliable and reputable, and that they don't expect any declines in your income or work for them in the future,\" says Andrews. Wingfield's husband got just such a letter from the supervisor at his security firm (where he eventually landed his current full-time job).\nSum it all up\nWhen you're done compiling (and carefully proofreading) all the documentation you need to supply, cap it off by writing a letter that summarizes your case.\n\"Here, you want to connect the dots,\" says Luna. \"Reaffirm your stability, ability, and willingness. State your application's strengths. And keep it brief. Three-quarters of a page should do.\"\nKeep trying\nFailed to secure the first home loan for which you applied? Don't give up hope.\n\"The lender we thought would be a sure bet -- our family credit union, where we had longstanding savings accounts and credit cards -- turned us down flat,\" says Wingfield. \"We managed to land a mortgage not by going with them or with a traditional bank, but by finding a lending company that specialized in helping borrowers whose situations were outside the normal box.\" Your real estate broker -- and nonprofit agencies in your community that focus on helping homeowners -- can steer you toward lenders who are right for you.\n\"We did what we needed to make our case,\" says Joy. \"We showed pay stubs, back tax forms, the works. Our mortgage approval took three months, but we got through it because we did our homework -- and did it right.\"\n-- -- -- -- --\nMore from realtor.com : Your Offer Was Accepted -- What Happens Now?",

Wingfield's husband got just such a letter from the supervisor at his security firm (where he eventually landed his current full-time job). \nSum it all up \nWhen you're done compiling (and carefully proofreading) all the documentation you need to supply, cap it off by writing a letter that summarizes your case. \n\"Here, you want to connect the dots,\" says Luna. \"Reaffirm your stability, ability, and willingness. State your application's strengths. And keep it brief. Three-quarters of a page should do.\" \nKeep trying \nFailed to secure the first home loan for which you applied? Don't give up hope. \n\"The lender we thought would be a sure bet -- our family credit union, where we had longstanding savings accounts and credit cards -- turned us down flat,\" says Wingfield. \"We managed to land a mortgage not by going with them or with a traditional bank, but by finding a lending company that specialized in helping borrowers whose situations were outside the normal box.\" Your real estate broker -- and nonprofit agencies in your community that focus on helping homeowners -- can steer you toward lenders who are right for you. \n\"We did what we needed to make our case,\" says Joy. \"We showed pay stubs, back tax forms, the works. Our mortgage approval took three months, but we got through it because we did our homework -- and did it right.\" \n-- -- -- -- -- Source: foxnews Keywords",

      "text": "April 20, 2016 9:20 AM I used to be a flight attendant. Dealing with passengers' racism is part of the job. \nFlight attendants often must referee when people with wildly different life experiences are crammed into an aircraft cabin \nSometimes you're asked to be someone's accomplice -- in their racism, their homophobia, their cruel joke Flight attendants are trained extensively in evaluating suspicious behavior. Donna McWilliam AP i Order Reprint of this Story \nIt was during the boarding process on a flight from Fort Lauderdale to JFK in the fall of 2009. I had long since learned the key to a pleasant flight was to greet everyone as they boarded, so I stood in the front galley and said my hellos. \nSuddenly a middle-aged white woman leaned uncomfortably close to me and whispered, \"There is man, four people behind me, in a green shirt, who is very suspicious.\" \nI whispered back, \"OK. What's he doing?\" \n\"You'll see,\" she said, wide-eyed. \nI thought two things: This woman is probably racist. And I need to take her seriously. \nAs a former flight attendant for a major carrier, I'm not surprised to hear that a Southwest Airlines passenger reported UC Berkeley student Khairuldeen Makhzoomi as suspicious after he said \"Inshallah\" (\"God willing\" in Arabic) during a phone call. Flight attendants are often made to play referee when hundreds of humans with wildly different life experiences are crammed into an aircraft cabin. \nIt's usually simple stuff, like moving the man with the severe dog allergy as far away as possible from the blind woman's service animal. Or asking the bachelor party to pipe down for the umpteenth time, because not everyone is going to Las Vegas to get drunk. \nFlight attendants are trained extensively in evaluating suspicious behavior. The training infuses you with an automatic paranoid vigilance that follows you forever and insists you take all threats seriously, since the cost of being wrong is too high. But nowhere does it recommend you accept a passenger's assessment of a situation, and nowhere does it teach that speaking Arabic is cause for suspicion. \nBut sometimes you're asked to be someone's accomplice -- in their racism, their homophobia, their cruel joke about the larger person seated next to them or their conviction that the mother in front of them should drug her child to shut him up. For professionals who are supposed to be polite, it can get awkward. \nOn the Southwest flight, Makhzoomi, after boarding and taking his seat, phoned an uncle and was speaking to him in Arabic. He told The Washington Post that he cut the call short after noticing that the woman seated in front of him had turned to stare. She left her seat, and soon afterward a Southwest employee told him he had to get off the plane. Makhzoomi complied. After being questioned by police officers and FBI agents, he eventually was released but was told he could not fly Southwest. He arrived home, he said, nine hours after his initial arrival time, on Delta Air Lines. \nSince Southwest has declined to explain its perspective, we have only Makhzoomi's account of what happened to go on. But if it's true that the flight attendant had no other interaction with him from the time the other passenger reported him to the time he was pulled off the plane - well, that shocks me. \nFlight attendants are trained extensively in evaluating suspicious behavior with videos, checklists, quizzes and drills. (And drills and drills and drills.) The training infuses you with an automatic paranoid vigilance that follows you forever and insists you take all threats seriously, since the cost of being wrong is too high. But nowhere does it recommend you accept a passenger's assessment of a situation, and nowhere does it teach that speaking Arabic is cause for suspicion. \nBefore that 2009 flight, after the woman alerted me to the \"suspicious\" passenger, I thanked her and told her I'd check him out. I watched the man closely as he stepped onto the plane, looking for signs of a terrorist. Was he jittery? Nope. Was he sweating? A little bit, but we were in South Florida; I was sweating, too. Was he wearing unseasonable clothing, like a big coat in the summertime? No. In fact, his Green Bay Packers jersey perfectly fit the season -- football season. \nDid he have trouble following a normal conversation? \n\"Hi, how're you doing today?\" I asked. \n\"Fine,\" he said, nodding casually. \n\"Going home?\" I asked. \n\"Nope, wedding,\" he said. \nAll right, no problems there. \nA few minutes later, after he'd reached his seat, I walked down the aisle to assess again, the woman who flagged him tracking me with her eyes. \nDid he hold on tightly to a piece of luggage? No, his carry-on was in the overhead bin. Did he sit stiffly? No, he was slouched in his seat, headphones on, already watching the game on the seatback TV. Not exactly the actions of person who believes he's about to die. \nThe only thing he appeared to have in common with the 9/11 hijackers was that he was brown. He could have been Punjabi or Puerto Rican. He could have been Catholic, or Sikh, or one of the many hundreds of millions of Muslims who have nothing to do with terrorism. I let it go and had no further discussion with the man or the woman, other than to serve them drinks and bid them well when they disembarked at JFK. I hope, and I think it's likely, that the man never noticed what was happening. \nI grew up in a wealthy, mostly white, mostly Mormon town out West. Respect for God's will for us was a frequent topic of conversation among my friends. And, like lots of future pilots and flight attendants, my favorite toy was the globe. I'd spin and spin it, dreaming of all the different, \"exotic\" places I'd go. Becoming a flight attendant made my dreams come true. That has included travel to Muslim-majority countries, where the frequent incantation of \"God willing\" quite frankly reminds me of home. \nSouthwest has a reputation for friendly customer service. I know Southwest flight attendants, and even in the relative privacy of their Facebook feeds, they talk of genuinely loving their passengers and the work they do to keep them safe and comfortable. \nWhen passengers reported an issue, we didn't know what their life experience was. That's why it was so important that we made assessments based on training. In this case, being friendly and being vigilant should have called for the same thing: a conversation. Anyone who makes a snap judgment from the cocoon of the galley has no business being a flight attendant. \nGillian Brockell is a video editor at The Washington Post. Related content",

      "text": "Bill Campbell, Mentor to Steve Jobs, Other Tech CEOs, Dies LATER \nBy Michael Liedtke . Updated April 20, 2016 10:16AM SHARE Eric Schmidt Bill Campbell, a former Ivy League football coach who became a management guru for Apple co-founder Steve Jobs and other Silicon Valley luminaries, has died. He was 75. \nHis death Monday was confirmed by Kleiner Perkins Caufield Byers, a venture capital firm that often called upon Campbell to help mold entrepreneurs as they tried to manage the rapid growth often triggered by their innovations. Campbell died after a long battle with cancer, according to the firm, which was speaking on behalf of his family. \nAlthough he wasn't widely known outside Silicon Valley, Campbell played a pivotal role in shaping the direction of both Apple and Google, two of the world's most powerful companies. \nAfter working in marketing and sales at Apple during the 1980s, Campbell joined the company's board in 1997, shortly after Jobs returned as the company's CEO. \nAt the time, Apple was flirting with bankruptcy. Campbell frequently served as Jobs' sounding board during one of the most resounding corporate turnarounds in U.S. history as Apple first redesigned its Mac computer line and then rolled out the iPod, iPhone and iPad to emerge as the world most valuable company. Campbell ended his 17-year stint on Apple's board in 2014. \nCampbell \"believed in Apple when few people did and his contributions to our company, through good times and bad, cannot be overstated,\" Apple said in a Monday statement. \nWhile working with Apple, Campbell played a behind-the-scenes role in Google's success, too. Prompted by Kleiner Perkins, Campbell worked with former Google CEO Eric Schmidt and company co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin to help them work out their early differences and eventually forge one of the most successful partnerships in corporate America. \nAlphabet, Google's corporate parent, is now the world's second most valuable company, ranking only behind Apple. \nIn a Facebook post, Schmidt credited Campbell for helping to build Google's culture and hailed his contributions to the company as \"incalculable.\" \n\"We started with him as an external coach but he quickly became the internal management expert,\" Schmidt wrote. \nCampbell stopped consulting with Google in 2010, citing the conflicts of interest that faced him as an Apple board member. Google makes the Android operating system that powers most of the products competing against Apple's trendsetting iPhone and iPad. \nCampbell's background gave little inkling he would become one of Silicon Valley's most influential figures. \nBefore joining Apple, Campbell spent six seasons as the head coach of Columbia University's football team. He compiled a 12-41-1 record at Columbia, a .231 winning percentage that was more than double that of his three successors. \nAs a student at Columbia, Campbell was the captain and an offensive guard on the football team that went 6-3 in 1961, including a 6-1 record in the Ivy League that earned the university a share of the conference title with Harvard. It's still the only time that Columbia's football team won the Ivy League. \nEven after he left football, Campbell remained known as \"Coach\" in Silicon Valley. He also owned an interest in a sports bar in Palo Alto, California, where he regularly met with friends and colleagues at a table with a brass plaque inscribed \"Coach's Corner.\" \nBefore becoming a mentor to other companies, Campbell was CEO of software maker Intuit Inc. from 1994 to 1998. He later served as that company's chairman until stepping down earlier this year. \n© 2016 Associated Press syndicated under contract with NewsEdge. All rights reserved.

The center houses millions of products that are sorted, packaged and sent out to clients in the region. Juan Guajardo Star-Telegram i Order Reprint of this Story \nOnline retailer Amazon.com announced Wednesday that it will open a second fulfillment center in Haslet and employ an additional 1,000 full-time workers at the facility. \nThe new center, located at 15201 Heritage Parkway just north of Alliance Airport, will be about one million square feet and is expected to open “soon,” said Amazon spokeswoman Ashley Robinson. The center will pick, pack and ship smaller items including books, electronics and toys. \nThis will be Amazon’s fourth fulfillment center in the Metroplex and its sixth in Texas. It opened its first Haslet facility at 700 Westport Parkway in 2013 and currently employs 3,000 full-time employees there. Its other Texas fulfillment centers are in Coppell, south Dallas and Schertz, with another under construction in San Marcos. \n“We are appreciative of the community, not just in Haslet but the entire Dallas area for its support of Amazon, its top-notch workforce and the customers who enable us to continually grow across the country,” said Amazon vice president Akash Chauhan in a statement. \nThe existing Haslet center uses Kiva Systems robots alongside employees to move products to be packaged for shipping. About 10 miles of conveyor belts also move products from one side of the facility to the other while unmanned automated guide vehicles transport items around the center. \nAmazon began to open fullfillment centers in Texas after reaching a settlement with the state in 2012 over unpaid sales taxes. In the settlement, Amazon agreed to pay the state sales tax, create 2,500 jobs and invest a minimum of $200 million in Texas over four years. \nRobinson said Amazon is already hiring for the new facility and accepting applications online at http://www.WorkatAmazonfulfillment.com . Full-time employees receive healthcare coverage, 401(k) benefits and company stock awards. The company also offers a program called Career Choice, which prepays up to 95 percent of tuition for courses related to in-demand fields, even if it is not relevant to a job at Amazon. \nSince opening its first Haslet facility, the Seattle-based company has created thousands of jobs and become a “great community partner,” said Haslet mayor Bob Golden. Last fall, Amazon donated 47 Kindle Fire HD tablets to students with special needs at Haslet Elementary. \nAndrea Ahles: 817-390-7631 , @Sky_Talk A worker stores items in the pick pods at Amazon’s Fulfillment Center in Haslet. The associates and robots work together to make Amazon’s deliveries as efficient as possible, said company representatives. Juan Guajardo Star-Telegram i",

      "text": "11:43 am - April 20, 2016 Lonoke’s Morris to take superintendent’s job in Yell County Nathan Morris \nBy Donna Lampkin Stephens \nNathan Morris, Lonoke’s girls basketball coach and athletic director as well as the district’s director of support services, is leaving after 11 years to become the superintendent of the Two Rivers School District in Yell County. \nMorris, 40, compiled an overall record of 230-113, including the last 11 seasons atop the Lady Jackrabbit program, and spent the last four as AD. He will begin his new job July 1. \n“I love the job I’m leaving, and because of that, it was going to take the right job to get me to leave,” he said. “I don’t feel like I’ve worked a day in 11 years. I loved every day of it, and even the days some would consider to be challenging or bad days, they were still good to me. \n“That’s just a tribute to the people here, the school, the students and former students and, most especially, my former players and current players. They made this the best stop I could imagine.” \nMorris finished his superintendent’s certificate last spring through Texas A&M-Texarkana. \n“I knew when I first got into coaching that I wasn’t sure if I’d be in it 30, 35 years because at some point a principal or superintendent’s job would interest me,” he said. “The last couple of years I’ve been afforded the opportunity to be in a central office role in Lonoke, and going to school and getting that certificate has put me in that direction to start looking.” \nThe support services sector of his job has included transportation, maintenance, food service and custodial services for the district. \n“Two Rivers was just a good fit. It certainly wasn’t something that I felt like I had to go. But it was just the right timing. The timing is key. It’s a great opportunity, and I didn’t know if the same one would come along in the next couple of years, so I felt like it was best to get on it now.” \nHe said Two Rivers was the first superintendent’s position he had pursued. \n“I wasn’t going to a place where I didn’t want to be,” he said. “We were looking for a good fit.” \nTwo Rivers in Yell County is the consolidated district of students from Ola, Plainview-Rover, Fourche Valley and Casa. \nMorris grew up in Beebe, and earned a Master of Arts in Teaching from the University of Arkansas in 1999 before taking his first coaching job at Dardanelle, where he spent four years with duties including assistant boys basketball and head baseball and softball. He then went to Camden Fairview for two years as assistant boys basketball coach and head softball and junior boys basketball coach before coming to Lonoke as head girls basketball coach. He added AD duties four years ago. Along the way, he finished a program of study in educational leadership for his principal’s license from Harding University in 2010. \nHe said Sunday applications for the girls basketball job were being sought for another week. \n“AD and my other duties are still kind of up in the air,” he said. “For the coaching job, I’ll compile a list and get it in the hands of the people it needs to go to. There will probably be a committee formed. \n“But I’m still here and running the athletic department until I’m done and a replacement is made. We’re going on, business as usual.” \nHe said he hoped those choices would be made by the May board meeting, scheduled for May 16, so the new coach would be able to start by early June for the Lady Jackrabbits’ summer schedule. \n“It is bittersweet because it’s been good,” he said of leaving Lonoke. “I’ve got probably enough coaching memories here in 11 years to last people 10 lifetimes. The kids here have been great. I’ve picked up more from them than they got from me.” \nHe said he had talked to multiple coaches about how to now when it’s time to make such a career change. \n“Everybody says you know, but you also know there’s probably no going back (to coaching),” he said. “But who knows? I could show back up as a seventh grade coach or a junior high basketball coach or a softball coach. It’s in my blood, and I don’t think it could ever leave. \n“Certainly next November, when the balls start bouncing, it’ll be a little disappointing, probably whole lot of me that wants to be out there. But these are new challenges, and instead of trying to win one on the floor or through the entire athletic department, I’m going to try to put my energy into winning with the whole school district. I’m looking forward to it. It’s a challenge and that’s what life’s about — accepting challenges and taking them on full-speed.” \nAbout to finish his 17th year in education, he could retire in 11 years. \n“I could easily see myself doing this until then,” he said. “You never know where the road leads, but I know the road through Lonoke’s been pretty good to me.”",

      "text": "Share this URL Kathy Kmonicek/Kathy Kmonicek Marcella Sills argues in court papers filed in Manhattan Supreme Court that the labor contract covering principals “specifies no particular start time.” \nA grade school principal in Far Rockaway who was fired in February for repeatedly being late and absent has sued to get her $128,000 a year job back. \nMarcella Sills, who was the principal of P.S. 106 from 2005 to 2014 when she was reassigned, argues in court papers filed Wednesday in Manhattan Supreme Court that the labor contract covering principals “specifies no particular start time.” \n“Accordingly, without a start time, there can’t be a late time,” her lawyer Douglas Rosenthal argues. \nQUEENS HIGH SCHOOL PRINCIPAL ACCUSED OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT, INFLATING GRADES IN TWO FEDERAL LAWSUITS \nAn arbitrator ruled earlier this year that because Sills’ expected reporting time was 8:30 a.m. when students arrive, she should be fired because she failed to be there on numerous occasions. \nThe arbitrator said Sills’ contract argument “defies common sense” because the contract has never been applied that way. \nRosenthal says the arbitrator exceeded his authority because school officials have stated that principals must work 7 hours and 15 minutes a day — but have not specified which hours. \nPS 106, which was clobbered by the Sandy, made headlines in 2014 when it was revealed that Sills had no Common Core textbooks, no art and no gym for students who often spent their days watching movies. \nA Law Department spokesman said “it’s entirely proper to fire a principal who persistently fails to show up for work on time. We'll review the complaint and respond accordingly.” Related Stories",

      "text": "increase font size Tax credit program expands to encourage college grads to take jobs in Maine Opportunity Maine credits of up to $4,500 per year are now available to grads with degrees from out of state. By Edward D. Murphy Staff Writer Read Article \nAfter a year and a half working for ESPN in Connecticut, Brendan Gilbert was eager to return to his native Maine. \nArmed with a degree in communications, he landed a job with Parta Co. in Brunswick, doing Web-based marketing. Brendan Gilbert of North Yarmouth says he'll pay off nearly two-thirds of his $10,000 in student loans through the Opportunity Maine tax-credit program. BY THE NUMBERS \nHere’s the average tax credit and the number of taxpayers who received them in 2014: \nSTEM-related credits: I.O. University: The rising costs of college Search photos available for purchase: Photo Store → \nAnd, to his surprise, he was able to net a lucrative state tax credit that he has used to help pay his student loan debt. \nGilbert has been telling his friends he considers the Opportunity Maine credit “a great benefit for people who want to stay in Maine.” \nGilbert and about 4,000 others have tapped the little-known program that awards tax credits to recent college grads who choose to work in Maine. Now, state officials hope a round of legislative tweaking and new promotional efforts will attract more recent college graduates – and in the process help build a more skilled workforce for Maine. \n“What we really want is for them (college graduates) to come back and live and work in Maine,” said Tracy Coughlin of Maine Education Services, a nonprofit that helps students and families plan and pay for college. MES has been administering and marketing the Opportunity Maine program since it was created in 2008, although the Maine Development Foundation will take over the marketing effort this year. \nWhen the program started, taxpayers had to be graduates of Maine colleges and working in Maine to qualify for tax credits, which can range up to $4,500 per year. \nOver the years, the rules have been loosened and, for the 2016 tax year, it will be open to all post-2008 college graduates – not just those from Maine colleges and universities – who take jobs in Maine. \nThe new rules will also offer more incentives to Maine companies to pay some or all of their employees’ student loans, even for employees holding graduate degrees. A company making student loan payments for an employee can claim the payments as a tax break on its annual filing. This year, the Legislature lifted the cap on the amount employers can pay on their workers’ student loans and still qualify for the tax credit. The credit is over $4,000 for a bachelor’s degree or nearly $800 for an associate degree, per eligible employee. \nSen. Justin Alfond, D-Portland, who sponsored a bill this year that included changes in the program, said he expects that provision will take off as more employers become aware of it. \n“It’s a huge recruiting tool,” he said, and will allow Maine employers to compete with out-of-state companies offering higher salaries. \nWORKERS IN SHORT SUPPLY \nEconomists are predicting that Maine will face a shortage of more than 100,000 workers by 2032 because of baby boomers retiring and the state’s low birth rate. Six out of every seven job openings in Maine over the next several years will be to replace existing workers leaving the labor force, which began shrinking in 2013, according to an analysis by the Maine Department of Labor. \n“That’s what we hear from employers around the state: workforce, workforce,” said Yellow Light Breen, chief executive officer of the Maine Development Foundation. “It’s the number one challenge facing the state.” \nOpportunity Maine is “a mostly unknown program,” he said, particularly the part that allows an employer to pay off a worker’s student loans and get a tax credit. Marketing it dovetails with other efforts that MDF is focused on to attract young, skilled workers to Maine, said Breen. \nIn testimony before the Taxation Committee, Rep. Mattie Daughtery, D-Brunswick, representing the Legislature’s Youth Caucus, argued for the expansion of the program to Mainers who got their college educations outside the state. \n“Student loan debt in particular keeps many in very difficult financial situations just starting out with their lives, with a third of millennials nationwide still living with their parents,” she said. “Let’s encourage those students to come back to Maine to live, work and play, avoiding the so-called brain drain scenario. We need those young people to help make Maine a more prosperous state.” \nTHE VALUE OF A STEM DEGREE \nThe amount that taxpayers can claim under the Opportunity Maine program varies, based on their individual tax and loan situations. Gilbert said his credit ends up covering about two-thirds of his annual payments on a $10,000 student debt he accumulated while earning a bachelor’s degree from the New England School of Communications at Husson University. He said he’s stretching out his payments to take advantage of the credit, which can be claimed over 10 years. \nThe federal government allows taxpayers to claim a deduction on interest paid on their student loans, but Coughlin said she thinks only one other state – Kansas – offers a state credit like Maine’s. \nIn 2014, the latest year for which figures are available, nearly 4,000 taxpayers claimed a credit under the program. Credits are higher for the highly desirable tech worker with a STEM (science, technology, education or math) degree. The average amount was $1,832 for people with a STEM degree. For college grads without a STEM degree, the average credit was a little more than $1,000. \nCoughlin said with Maine’s unemployment rate below 4 percent, it may seem odd to push a program to invite more workers to move here. But she noted that many employers say they are having a hard time finding skilled workers. \nAnd with Maine’s aging workforce, many skilled workers are retiring, so she said the program is a good way to attract young skilled workers to replace them. \n“We want to make it a strong, powerful tool” for improving the quality of the workforce, she said.",

      "text": "Explore \nCollege graduation season is upon us, and there’s no shortage of advice columnists offering tips to recent college grads on how to land that first, full-time job. Some discuss what today’s employers are looking for—candidates who are resourceful, intuitive, self-starting and sincere (like that’s a surprise)—while others suggest strategies for devising eye-catching resumes. \nThis isn’t one of those columns. My financial services colleagues and I actually had a preference for hiring recent grads for three good reasons: \nThey travel light . Although most will have worked part-time while in college and, ideally, completed an internship that coincided with their studies and professional aspirations, recent grads come with relatively little baggage. In other words, there aren’t a lot of bad habits to break or attitudes to change. \nThey’re malleable . Because they travel light and are usually pretty enthusiastic about their first full-time gig, recent grads are more easily trained. \nThey know more than we do . No matter how with it we hirers believe we are, recent grads are also that much more comfortable—often to the point of fearlessness—with technology. Consequently, we learned as much from them as they from us. \nContrary to what you might believe or hope, the hiring process isn’t akin to speed dating. In fact, although many of us feel good about the gut decisions we often make on the fly, I’ve learned the hard way that first impressions aren’t always correct. That’s why God invented second and third interviews. \nSo here’s how to get started. \nYour resume should coincide with the position you seek or the posting to which you are responding. Not only should you not embellish it, but you should absolutely never misstate any of your qualifications, experiences or academic background. You never know who’s going to pick up the phone to check on these. \nAlso, take care to choose your references wisely—in particular, those who can speak to the qualifications you need for the position you have in mind—and make certain they’re prepared for the call. I can’t tell you how many times I’ve contacted an unprepared or-, worse- , a reference who didn’t even know that his or her name was given…, to the detriment of the applicant. \nYour cover letter is equally important. Use it to make a brief and respectful case for your favorable consideration while at the same time a glimpse of your personality. Believe me, it makes a difference to know that as focused and determined as you may be, you don’t take yourself more seriously than you should. \nNow, suppose that your resume and cover letter do what they’re supposed to do: attract interest. It’s time to prepare for the first hurdle: the dreaded phone screen. Sure, we’re trying to weed out the obvious bad fits crazies and those who are inexplicably incapable of advocating for themselves. But we’re also looking for those who’ve taken the time do the research into what we do, how we do it, and are able to persuasively articulate how they believe they can help, (if only we would agree to meet them). \nYou see, the singular objective for the phone screen is to score an in-person interview . It’s where you’ll have as much of an opportunity to impress as you will to assess. I’ll discuss that in a minute. In the Meantime, keep these three things in mind. \nDress appropriately . Even if they say they’re business casual, endure the ridicule and crank it up a notch to show respect. \nSpeak knowledgably and confidently on the subjects you know . Never attempt to bluff your way through the things you don’t know. The odds are against you on that one. \nBe prepared to ask questions . Many interviewers close by asking if the candidate has any questions he or she would like to ask. “Nope” is not a good answer. In fact, you should look at that question as an ideal opportunity to showcase the initiative you took by researching the organization in advance of your meeting. \nAsk for the timeline . The close of the interview is also a good time to ask for a sense for their decision-making process and for permission to follow up at a later date. \nTwo more things to do as you prepare for your audition. \nClean up your online act . So much information is so readily available these days that it would be a mistake to believe that the things you wouldn’t want your mother to see won’t end up on a prospective employer’s monitor. \nPersonal financial management counts . Although many states have enacted or are contemplating legislation that limits the use of credit scores and credit bureau reports in the hiring process, there are exceptions. My own industry, for example, is one of those because our positions are often directly or indirectly tied to financial transactions. \nAnd if the opportunity you seek is one that requires a credit check as part of the hiring process, know these three things: \nFirst, under the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA) , no employer is permitted to order your credit report without your written consent. \nSecond, under the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) , the three principal credit bureaus (Equifax, Experian and TransUnion) are required to provide you with a free credit report , annually. It would be agood idea to know what yours says before you’re asked about it. \nThird, if there are items on your report that concern you, I suggest you discuss these forthrightly when you’re asked to grant that permission, because that’s when it’ll count—not before. \nI’ve heard lots of stories about divorces, medical emergencies, student loan burdens and even past employment interruptions. Life happens, and. But as long your credit bureau report shows that you have or are working through your problems in a responsible manner, you shouldn’t be overly concerned. On the other hand, betting that a chronic case of late payments and account closures won’t come up isn’t one a bet worth taking. \nFinally, I said before that in-person interviews are opportunities for mutual assessment. In particular, there are three things to consider as you make your way through the process. \nIs this the kind of work you want to do ? Does it coincide with your education and interests? Will the tasks that you’ll be asked to complete present enough of a challenging enoughe to keep you engaged? \nHow do you feel about the people and the work environment ? In particular, what do you think of the person to whom you’ll report? What about the people with whom you’ll work? What’s your sense of the environment: calm, busy, frenetic, pressure cooker? \nWill these folks help you to become more tomorrow than you are today? Will they train and mentor you? Do they offer a reasonably attainable career path? Is there a continuing education reimbursement program? Will there be opportunities to explore other areas within the organization if you choose? \nThis last group of questions is the most important of them all. Not only does it represent the difference between a short-term job and, potentially, a lifelong career, but it also offers invaluable insight into how management views its employees—as individuals who are worthy of investment or commodities to plug and play. \nThe right kind of employer will want to do all they can to make your time there worthwhile—for both your sakes—not least because recruiting, onboarding, training and helping new hires to become productive is time-consuming and costly. So it follows that if your prospective employer is so inclined, you can also look forward to a compensation package that’s both competitive and fair. \nThis story is an Op/Ed contribution to Credit.com and does not necessarily represent the views of the company or its partners.

Sign up for free newsletters to get more of the AJC delivered to your inbox. \nCollege graduation season is upon us, and there’s no shortage of advice columnists offering tips to recent college grads on how to land that first, full-time job. Some discuss what today’s employers are looking for—candidates who are resourceful, intuitive, self-starting and sincere (like that’s a surprise)—while others suggest strategies for devising eye-catching resumes. \nThis isn’t one of those columns. My financial services colleagues and I actually had a preference for hiring recent grads for three good reasons: \nThey travel light . Although most will have worked part-time while in college and, ideally, completed an internship that coincided with their studies and professional aspirations, recent grads come with relatively little baggage. In other words, there aren’t a lot of bad habits to break or attitudes to change. \nThey’re malleable . Because they travel light and are usually pretty enthusiastic about their first full-time gig, recent grads are more easily trained. \nThey know more than we do . No matter how with it we hirers believe we are, recent grads are also that much more comfortable—often to the point of fearlessness—with technology. Consequently, we learned as much from them as they from us. \nContrary to what you might believe or hope, the hiring process isn’t akin to speed dating. In fact, although many of us feel good about the gut decisions we often make on the fly, I’ve learned the hard way that first impressions aren’t always correct. That’s why God invented second and third interviews. \nSo here’s how to get started. \nYour resume should coincide with the position you seek or the posting to which you are responding. Not only should you not embellish it, but you should absolutely never misstate any of your qualifications, experiences or academic background. You never know who’s going to pick up the phone to check on these. \nAlso, take care to choose your references wisely—in particular, those who can speak to the qualifications you need for the position you have in mind—and make certain they’re prepared for the call. I can’t tell you how many times I’ve contacted an unprepared or-, worse- , a reference who didn’t even know that his or her name was given…, to the detriment of the applicant. \nYour cover letter is equally important. Use it to make a brief and respectful case for your favorable consideration while at the same time a glimpse of your personality. Believe me, it makes a difference to know that as focused and determined as you may be, you don’t take yourself more seriously than you should. \nNow, suppose that your resume and cover letter do what they’re supposed to do: attract interest.

      "text": "By Natasha Korecki ( nkorecki@politico.com ; @natashakorecki) with Manuela Tobias ( mtobias@politico.com ; @manuelatobiasm) Good Thursday morning, Illinois. Last night, Mayor Rahm Emanuel announced he was accepting recommended changes from a police oversight board but pulled back on making a change to perhaps the most sought after change: eliminating the Independent Review Police Authority board, saying he wanted to get an OK from the Justice Department that's reviewing his department.\nNOT JUST MOVING FURNITURE AROUND: \"Mayor Rahm Emanuel on Wednesday announced changes to restore trust in the police, but stopped short of the two most controversial recommendations from his hand-picked task force: disbanding the Independent Police Review Authority and reopening the police contract. 'I don’t want to just move furniture around. I want to spend as much political capital as I have to get this right. We’ve got to get the structure right so there’s credibility in the public and credibility in the police department that there’s oversight,' Emanuel said in a telephone interview with the Chicago Sun-Times.\" http://bit.ly/1rofdNG\nTime Magazine with the Marshall Project , published a lengthy piece disclosing that before the Justice Department launched a pattern and practice investigation into racial bias and misconduct in the police department, it was looking at Chicago as a ‘model’ of policing strategies in the wake of Ferguson. Someone was asleep at the wheel, to say the least. Details below, including a first interview from the officer who shot and killed a bystander, Bettie Jones, while responding to a call for a teen threatening his dad with a baseball bat. The officer killed him too.\nIn Chicago, news broke last night that the principal famous for irking Mayor Rahm Emanuel was removed from his school principal post.\nElsewhere in Illinois, one of the only counties to back Bruce Rauner’s rudderless Turnaround Agenda just rescinded it. And local governments are scrambling after they learned the state sent them too much money -- and now wants it back.\nCHICAGO USED AS ‘MODEL’ OF POLICING, BEFORE DEPT. CONDEMNED AS HAVING ‘SYSTEMIC RACISM’ -- “The Police Laboratory,” by Simone Weichselbaum for TIME with the Marshall Project: “As the country’s most violent big city struggled to contain an epidemic of deadly shootings, the police force opened itself up to top criminologists, law professors and sociologists … The police would be transformed, as the reformers put it, from 'warriors' to 'guardians.' Policymakers nationwide were intrigued by Chicago’s alliance of academics and law enforcement, and the ‘Chicago model’ of policing strategies influenced departments from Oakland, Calif., to New York City. The Justice Department is spending millions of dollars promoting ideas hatched in the Chicago workshop.”\nUm … but things really weren’t that great: “ An array of academic theories and programs nurtured by McCarthy are now in limbo. On March 15, angry Chicago voters threw out the state’s attorney, Anita Alvarez, in a primary election viewed as a referendum on police excesses and the perceived indifference of city hall.\"\n‘Hammered’: “Police officers, their supervisors and their unions have hunkered down. ‘If we are going to be hammered for everything that we do,’ then it’s safer to do nothing, says Sergeant James Ade, who runs Chicago’s police sergeants’ union. “If we don’t do anything, then we can’t get hammered.”\nOfficer Rialmo, who shot and killed Bettie Jones, speaks: “‘If you want to be a guardian in Chicago, be prepared to start going to a lot of cops’ funerals,’ says Rialmo during a series of interviews with the Marshall Project, his first since the shooting.\nOn the shooting: “‘I feel terrible about it to this day, and will for the rest of my life ... but people don’t know how it was to be in that situation, and ‘sorry’ will never cut it.’” http://ti.me/1MJ3QJy\nRAHM CRITIC SUDDENLY YANKED FROM JOB -- “Troy LaRaviere, Outspoken CPS Principal, Ousted And Told To Stay Home,” by DNAinfo’s Ariel Cheung: “ Controversial Principal Troy LaRaviere, an outspoken critic of Chicago Public Schools and Mayor Rahm Emanuel, has been ousted as head of Blaine Elementary School in a sudden change that left some parents shocked.Parents were notified late Wednesday of the abrupt change in leadership in an email from Elizabeth Kirby, chief of schools strategy and planning for Chicago Public Schools. Wednesday was LaRaviere's last day at Blaine, and he was ‘reassigned from his principal duties’ … He will continue to receive pay for now … The district is accusing LaRaviere of ‘acts of misconduct, including violations of a previous warning resolution passed by the Board of Education,’ spokeswoman Emily Bittner said. ‘A hearing will be held to determine his employment status.’” http://dnain.fo/1ScUpCs\nThis may have been the last straw: http://cbsloc.al/1VmbigG\n‘ACTS OF TERROR ON POOR AND WORKING CLASS’ -- “CTU President Karen Lewis calls Gov. Rauner ‘new ISIS recruit,’” by Chicago Sun-Times' Mitch Dudek: “Chicago Teachers Union President Karen Lewis called Gov. Bruce Rauner a ‘new ISIS recruit.' 'Has Homeland Security checked this man out yet? Because the things he’s doing look like acts of terror on poor and working class people,' she said, citing Rauner’s decision to slash millions in state funding to CPS and numerous social service groups. 'He talks about me all the time, so guess what, gloves are off,' Lewis told reporters after speaking at a luncheon hosted by the City Club of Chicago ... She said that Rauner’s use of the state budget impasse — and its negative impact on social services and education — as leverage to achieve union-weakening reforms equates to terrorism ... 'This kind of rhetoric has no place in American public discourse and sets a terrible example for our kids,' Rauner spokesperson Catherine Kelly wrote in an emailed statement.” http://bit.ly/1MJ3ClT\nMEL REYNOLDS RUNAROUND REACHES DEAD END -- “Former U.S. Rep. Mel Reynolds taken into custody — again,” by Chicago Tribune's Jason Meisner: “Former U.S. Rep. Mel Reynolds, awaiting trial on misdemeanor tax charges, was once again taken into custody Wednesday after a federal judge chastised him for apparently lying about his travels to Africa to care for an ill daughter. 'I went out on a limb,' U.S. District Judge John Darrah said before ordering Reynolds be taken to the Metropolitan Correctional Center. 'The story you gave me was just that — a story.' Reynolds, who moments earlier had fired his attorney and asked to represent himself, pleaded with Darrah to remain free on bond so he can prepare for his trial. 'Your honor, I'm not a flight risk,' said Reynolds, 64. 'These are misdemeanor charges ... I'm not going to run myself into a felony'\" http://trib.in/1TjS07S\nWelcome to the POLITICO Illinois Playbook. Have a tip, event, announcement, endorsement?

How much suburban school districts, towns, park districts and other governments owe the state varies widely but approaches $900,000 in some cases. State officials aren't asking for it all back at once … The problem lies with the obscure Personal Property Replacement Tax, revenue that's collected by the state and distributed to local governments.”\nMoney to be ‘docked over time’ -- “A change in law while Pat Quinn was governor created errors in sending about $168 million to about 6,500 taxing bodies. A state spokesman said local governments won't have to send the state a check, but the money will be docked over time from future tax payouts. The error is unrelated to the historically long budget stalemate between Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner and Democratic lawmakers. But some local governments have had to clamor for the money they're owed, and this latest wrinkle isn't likely to sit well. http://bit.ly/1QoNMrc\nTEACHERS PUSH FOR PROGRESSIVE TAX -- “Illinois teachers call for graduated tax, budget,” Associated Press: “Educators from Illinois schools and universities are pushing for a graduated income tax to generate revenue for public education and human services … They also highlighted the impact of the budget impasse on higher education and objected to a school funding plan offered by Gov. Bruce Rauner that disproportionately impacts poor districts. Rally organizer Amisha Patel of the Chicago-based Grassroots Collaborative says revenue generated from a graduated income tax could support higher education and social services operating without state funds since July 1.” http://bit.ly/1TjSkDG\n\"Hundreds rally in support of higher education in state,\" by The Southern's Dan Petrella: \"Several hundred students, employees and supporters from universities and colleges across the state rallied near the Capitol on Wednesday to pressure lawmakers and Gov. Bruce Rauner to reach a compromise to fund higher education. Because of the ongoing standoff between Republican Rauner and the Democrats who control the General Assembly, public universities and community colleges have gone nearly 10 months without any state funding. The state has also failed to fund grants to low-income students through the Monetary Award Program, which has forced colleges — including private schools — to choose between fronting the money to students or letting them take on the cost.\" http://bit.ly/1MJ5ydW\nQUICK, PAINLESS DEATH -- “State: Demmer’s public notices bill DOA,\" by The Rock River Times: \"A bill to pull public notices from print proposed by State Rep. Tom Demmer, R-Dixon, has died on the floor of the Illinois House. HB 6098 would have called for the end of requiring government bodies to print their public notices in papers of record across the state ... Demmer’s bill was another in a long line of attempts by the GOP to pass similar laws across the nation. Last year, State Rep. Joe Sosnowski proposed similar legislation that failed in the House. 'Local governments know that newspapers get the message out best,’ the IPA said earlier this week. ‘When they want to publicize issues of concern, they don’t post it on their website – they go to the media.'” http://bit.ly/1TjS87w\nFIGHTING A FANTASY -- “Casinos, Illinois Gaming Board fight fantasy sports measure,” by Crain’s Danny Ecker: “An amended bill that would legalize and regulate fantasy sports in Illinois is one step closer to becoming law, despite strong opposition from other gambling stakeholders and the Illinois Gaming Board. In a 9-4 vote following heated testimony and concerns that the bill was being rushed, the House Criminal Law Committee today sent House Bill 4323, known as the Fantasy Contests Act, to the House floor.\nComprehensive law: ‘State lawmakers in the House could vote on the bill, authored by Rep. Mike Zalewski, D-Riverside, as soon as tomorrow, but committee members today said it still needs major changes before becoming law. 'Constituents of ours play these games regardless of whether we agree with their decision to do so,' Zalewski testified today in Springfield. 'This is an opportunity to create a safe place for these games to occur. We have an opportunity to pass one of the most comprehensive daily fantasy sports laws in the country.’” http://bit.ly/1MJ4uqF\nBACKTRACKING ON TURNAROUND AGENDA -- “McHenry County settles union lawsuit over 'Turnaround Agenda' vote for $25K,” by Northwest Herald's Katie Dahlstrom: “The McHenry County Board on Tuesday pulled its symbolic support of Gov. Bruce Rauner's effort to turn Illinois around in order to settle a lawsuit prompted by the board's support of the governor's agenda …\nSecret meeting with Rauner? “The County Board's 18-4 vote rescinded its nonbinding 2015 resolution backing Rauner's 'Turnaround Agenda' in exchange for the International Union of Operating Engineers Local 150 dropping its lawsuit alleging board members who met with Rauner before the vote violated the Illinois Open Meetings Act. Although the County Board admitted no wrongdoing in the resolution, the settlement includes paying $25,000 to cover Local 150's legal fees …\n“ County Board Chairman Joe Gottemoller , R-Crystal Lake, said Wednesday … ‘You understand you’re risking $1 million in attorney fees … I’m not willing to risk that much of taxpayer money just to prove I’m right.’ He added that McHenry County was the only county in the state to adopt the agenda, which he said appears to have become an afterthought, even for Rauner.” http://bit.ly/1MJ5aw4\nWAIT TILL NEXT YEAR -- “Illinois might not get budget deal done until after November election,” by Our Quad City's Jim Niedelman: “The Democrats pushed through their latest spending plan, but certainly can't think Governor Rauner will be on board and sign it. That puts the onus back on Democrats to see if they will be able to override the governor's veto even though they haven't been able to so far. 'The Democrats, I don't think can override this bill with their own party,’ said Illinois Capitol Bureau Chief Matt Porter. ‘They just have one or two members who are not willing to get on the limb.' There was some thinking after the Illinois primary that those results might help break the ice in terms of a budget deal. But, we haven't seen that impact yet.\" http://bit.ly/1MJ5ivB\n\"Wagner, Blunt, Kirk join pushback against Obama investment adviser rule,\" by St. Louis Post-Dispatch's Chuck Raasch: \"Republicans in Congress are pushing back on a new Obama administration rule requiring financial services advisers to put their clients' interests first, a regulation critics say could restrict advice given to low- and middle-income savers. Opponents face long odds of actually stopping the new rule, however, because even if it passes Congress it would likely elicit a veto by President Barack Obama … both the House and Senate this week introduced resolutions to block the ‘fiduciary rule,’ which President Barack Obama’s Labor Department announced in early April. St. Louis-area Republicans have been among the loudest critics of the rule.\" http://bit.ly/1MJ5riv\nOTHER STATE HEADLINES:\nProposed millionaire tax amendment fails in Illinois House - News - The State Journal-Register - Springfield, IL: http://bit.ly/1pjhMPd\nIllinois Senate Votes to Decriminalize Marijuana Possession | NBC Chicago http://bit.ly/1rn6Stz\n“Key to Illinois budget deal is public outcry,” BGA: http://bit.ly/20ZiuyL\n“Voice of The Southern: We all will wait in line,” The Southern h ttp://bit.ly/1U6Y9Xr\nCITY\nDOROTHY BROWN AIDE PLEADS GUILTY -- “Ex-Dorothy Brown worker pleads guilty to lying to grand jury,\" by Chicago Sun-Times' Jon Seidel: “Cook County’s embattled circuit court clerk may have won the Democratic primary last month, but her trouble at the federal courthouse continued to haunt her Wednesday. Former clerk employee Sivasubramani Rajaram, 48, pleaded guilty to perjury Wednesday morning, admitting he lied Oct. 1 to a federal grand jury that had been investigating the purchasing of jobs and promotions within Dorothy Brown’s office. His plea agreement does not indicate he is cooperating with federal investigators.

O'Connell: “The nonprofit group Friends of the Parks, whose lawsuit opposing the original Lucas Museum plan along the lakefront forced the city to unveil a new proposal last week, said Wednesday it is still seeking more information about the McCormick Place idea before making a decision about next steps. City officials have been speaking with Friends of the Parks leadership since the new plan started to take shape … 'We are pleased that the mayor and the City recently opened the door to Friends of the Parks for more direct conversation about the Lucas Museum. Our intent, as it always has been, is to protect, preserve and promote parks and to ensure that everyone has the best possible access to lakefront land, while encouraging the City to find the right spot for the Lucas Museum,” Executive Director Juanita Irizarry said in a statement.” http://trib.in/1MJ4arG\nMONEY HERE, BUT NOT THERE -- “Rahm's Lucas/McPier plan is straight outta Daley's playbook of south-loop boondoggles,\" by The Reader's Ben Joravsky: \"In an effort to demonstrate just how far he'll go before adequately funding Chicago Public Schools, Mayor Emanuel has proposed a multi-billion dollar Rube Goldberg scheme to pay for demolishing McCormick Place and replacing it with George Lucas's proposed Star Wars museum. A project no one asked for or even knew we needed. Of course, the Lucas Museum could just as easily go on the big swath of land the city already owns just up the road from McCormick Place, where Michael Reese Hospital used to be. But why would the mayor do something so logical, with so many other galaxies of waste and absurdity left to conquer?”\n“Not so coincidentally, news of the mayor's latest Lucas/McCormick scheme broke on the same day that schools CEO Forrest Claypool announced that CPS couldn't afford to up its contract offer to teachers because it's so broke it would have to borrow more money 'to keep the doors open.'\" http://bit.ly/1MJ4CWY\nAdding -- “Mayor Daley's Mayoral Misspeaks Remembered (Like 'Mellencrap,' Scrootened'),” DNAinfo’s Mark Konkol: http://dnain.fo/23KOcoG\nWorst 10 places to leave your bike in Chicago -- DNAinfo: http://dnain.fo/1WGNymB\nHarriet Tubman lands on the $20 bill http://nyti.ms/1ScrgqW\n“Most interesting responses to Harriet Tubman being on the $20 bill,” The Chicago Defender http://bit.ly/1VGVwNb\nTODAY: The Latino caucus will hold a press briefing in Springfield to discuss substance abuse treatment funding.\n-- Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle will deliver welcome remarks at the National Organization of Black County Officials 32 nd Annual Economic Development Conference.\nWHERE’s RAHM?

Breaking News Staff CAMDEN — \nA longtime Preble Shawnee teacher-coach fighting for his job plans to appeal a vote to put him on unpaid leave — with the intention to fire him — following an investigation into allegations of sexual conduct that did not produce any charges. \nDistrict officials are calling it a situation that comes down to criminal actions vs. a school district’s code of conduct. \nSupporters of teacher-coach Greg Stacy are calling it an unfair judgment on a good educator who has been with the district for more than 20 years. Some of the backers, which included parents, even threatened to pull their future support of school levies. \nThursday night’s school board meeting attracted an overflow crowd wanting to see how the board would deal with Preble Shawnee Junior-Senior High School teacher. \nPaula Richardson, an organizer of the supporters, said, “We believe in him, he’s a great guy, he’s a great teacher, great person, great coach, and they’ve got it all wrong.” \nThe district’s investigation began in November when a student pressed a sexual harassment complaint. The complaint included accusations that Stacy sent texts to female students, engaged in inappropriate touching and created the appearance of favoritism. \nThe Preble County Sheriff’s Office never found any basis to pursue criminal charges. \nThe district moved forward anyway. \nThursday night, Superintendent David Ulrich told News Center 7’s Natalie Jovonovich, “There is different standards between criminal prosecution and the adherence to board policy and that because of those different standards, you have obviously a different result.” \nThe board voted 5-0 to terminate Stacy’s contract at the end of the school year. \nHis backers immediately registered their unhappiness. “Wow, wow, shame on all of you! Election time! \n“To hell with this place man! Shame on all of you, shame on all of you. I will never vote for another Preble Shawnee levy!” \nAttorney Brian Muenchenbach said his client, Stacy, has been “faithfully dedicated to these students. They have thrived in his care. The allegations against him are completely unsubstantiated.” \nMuenchenbach said before the board meets next on May 19 — when the members will make Stacy’s termination official — he plans to appeal Thursday night’s vote so he can get a hearing before a neutral referee who will hear from witnesses.",

      "text": "A longtime Preble Shawnee teacher-coach fighting for his job plans to appeal a vote to put him on unpaid leave — with the intention to fire him — following an investigation into allegations of sexual conduct that did not produce any charges.\nDistrict officials are calling it a situation that comes down to criminal actions vs. a school district’s code of conduct.\nSupporters of teacher-coach Greg Stacy are calling it an unfair judgment on a good educator who has been with the district for more than 20 years. Some of the backers, which included parents, even threatened to pull their future support of school levies.\nThursday night’s school board meeting attracted an overflow crowd wanting to see how the board would deal with Preble Shawnee Junior-Senior High School teacher.\nPaula Richardson, an organizer of the supporters, said, “We believe in him, he’s a great guy, he’s a great teacher, great person, great coach, and they’ve got it all wrong.”\nThe district’s investigation began in November when a student pressed a sexual harassment complaint. The complaint included accusations that Stacy sent texts to female students, engaged in inappropriate touching and created the appearance of favoritism.\nThe Preble County Sheriff’s Office never found any basis to pursue criminal charges.\nThe district moved forward anyway.\nThursday night, Superintendent David Ulrich told News Center 7’s Natalie Jovonovich, “There is different standards between criminal prosecution and the adherence to board policy and that because of those different standards, you have obviously a different result.”\nThe board voted 5-0 to terminate Stacy’s contract at the end of the school year.\nHis backers immediately registered their unhappiness. “Wow, wow, shame on all of you!

      "text": "How to Get an Approved Mortgage Even Without a Full-Time Job Posted by Staff Reporter ( ) on Apr 22, 2016 08:12 AM EDT print more big GLASGOW - DECEMBER 06: In this photo illustration mortgage application forms sit on a desk on December 6, 2007 in Glasgow,Scotland.The British economy is beginning to feel the effects of the credit crisis which began this year. House prices have begun to fall and the retail sector is predicting a difficult Christmas period. (Photo : Jeff J Mitchell/Getty Images) \nApplying for a mortgage is a long and tedious process, which requires the submission of a handful of financial documents to prove your capacity to pay the loan. While having good credit scores is one of the requirements to getting an approved mortgage, having a full-time job also provides security for the lenders. Can you still get an approved mortgage if you do not have a full-time job? Like Us on Facebook \nThe answer is yes; you can still get an approved mortgage if you do not have a full-time job. However, the already long and tedious process of submitting documents will take longer and will require additional documents to prove your capacity to pay the monthly mortgage payments. \nSince a full-time job acts as a reassurance on the part of the lenders that you have a steady source of income, many lenders are wary of approving mortgage applicants who do not have a full-time job. According to Realtor.com , those who are freelancers, Uber drivers or contract workers can still get an approved mortgage with the submission of additional documents. \nFor instance, one can submit a proof that you were able to pay your monthly rents in full and on time. You can ask your landlord to write a letter, confirming that you have had a stellar track record as a renter. \nAside from this, you may also show other proofs of your financial capabilities such as your credit card bills or student loan payments. You may also need to show that you have savings in your account. \nIf, however, you do not have the aforementioned requirements, you can still get an approved mortgage through a co-signer. As previously reported here on Realty Today , a co-signer can be a parent, family member or a friend with good credit, who is willing to act as a guarantor for the lender in case you default on your monthly mortgage payments.

      "text": "As an aviation structure mechanic, Kraig Reed used to restore the bodywork of aircraft when he was in the Navy.\nWhile serving the country, Reed got to travel to Singapore, Australia, Hong Kong and Diego Garcia, an island located south of the equator in the central Indian Ocean, where Reed said he often saw hundreds of sharks while he worked.\n\"It's a breeding ground for many marine animals, and it's really something to see,\" Reed said.\nOn Thursday, the 57-year-old Milwaukee resident was looking for something a little different to do with his time while visiting the biannual veteran's job fair at Great Lakes.\nDuring the event, 200 hundred military members and their families visited 80 booths where employers and veterans-organization officials eagerly greeted them and invited them to learn more about their agencies.\nSharon Huiett, chief operating officer of the Glenview-based software sales company LDG/Team Lear, said she was happy to participate in the fair.\n\"I'm looking for people who are hungry to work and have the gift of gab,\" Huiett said. \"Those highly motivated and energetic folks.\"\nOn Thursday, Huiett found two candidates who fit that description, and they'll likely be getting a call with a job offer, she said.\nWaukegan District 60 considers expanding student laptop program Emily K. Coleman The one-to-one technology initiative that put a device in the hands of every Waukegan High School student could be spreading to middle school, officials said.\nThe Waukegan School District 60 Board of Education is set to make the call at its Tuesday board meeting on whether the expansion will occur.\n... The one-to-one technology initiative that put a device in the hands of every Waukegan High School student could be spreading to middle school, officials said.\nThe Waukegan School District 60 Board of Education is set to make the call at its Tuesday board meeting on whether the expansion will occur.\n... (Emily K. Coleman) Ted Uchiek, deputy chief in the corrections department of the Lake County Sheriff's Office, said he believes veterans often make great law enforcement employees. \"But I might be a little biased,\" Uchiek joked, as he served 22 years in the Navy and retired as a senior chief in 1998.\n\"People who have been in the service know how to follow orders and the chain of command,\" Uchiek said. \"Not many think of the jail when they're looking for job opportunities, but there are plenty.\"\nCorrections officers and deputy sheriffs were on hand to discuss the work with those who were interested.\nAt the American Legion booth, Wayne T. Macejak, director at the Veterans Affairs and Rehabilitation department, answered questions about veteran benefits available to them and their family members.\n\"Have you heard of the GI Bill?\" Macejak asked those who walked by. \"The American Legion drafted it,\" he said before they had a chance to answer him. Then he handed them a pamphlet with information on many more benefits created by the federal program..\nFrom banks to delivery companies and coffee houses, the veterans' job fair provided a host of opportunities for those looking to slow down the pace and get ready to retire to start a career outside the military.\n\"People who attend these fairs come from all walks of life and from all over the world, and we think that's very attractive to employers,\" said Kevin Jones of the Great Lakes Family Employment Readiness Program.\nWhile Reed's job search would go beyond Thursday, he's participating in the Vocational Rehabilitation Unit at Great Lakes, where veterans train to develop skills for jobs outside the service. Reed is looking for employment in the medical field, such as a medical supplies technician, which is a job he's performed.\nThe veterans' job fair is sponsored twice a year by Naval Station Great Lakes Fleet and Family Support Center Transition Assistance Program and Family Employment Readiness Program, and the Captain James A. Lovell Federal Health Care Center Vocational Rehabilitation Program.\n ",

      "text": "Chicago State University student Terry Harris, wearing a stripe, blue necktie, entered a job fair at Thornton High School in Harvey with shining confidence.\nThe 23-year-old psychology major, who works as a part-time fast food waiter, said he hoped to find a job offering health insurance and more hours.\n\"I am not necessarily looking for a specific job with a specific company,\" said Harris, who lives with his parents in Dolton. \"The most important thing to me right now is obtaining health insurance benefits. I am looking for an opportunity that can help me grow as an independent adult.\"\nHarris was one of more than 700 people last Saturday attending the third annual Youth Job and Resource Expo hosted by U.S. Rep. Robin Kelly at Thornton's gymnasium at 15001 Broadway Ave.\nThe job fair comes as recent news reports show area young blacks, like Harris, are struggling to either find full-time or part-time work. Unlike Harrris, nearly 40 percent of black 20-24-year-olds were both out of work and out of school in Cook County in 2014, according to a recent report released by the Great Cities Institute at the University of Illinois at Chicago.\nIn the south suburbs, joblessness also is high. A jobless rate of more than 60 percent of 20-to-24 years olds was reported in several suburbs, such as Harvey, Markham, Hazel Crest, Sauk Village and Ford Heights.\n\"Youth joblessness in the Chicago area is at record-breaking levels,\" said Kelly, a Matteson Democrat, who represents the 2nd Congressional District in a statement. \"Because U.S. economy is still recovering, summer jobs are tough to find. I believe it's important that we work to provide more opportunities for young people. My job fair brought together many employers and agencies under one roof, making it possible for young people to apply for several jobs in one afternoon and link up with resource agencies that will help them succeed.\"\nCareer fair shows options, opportunity for jobs Karen Caffarini A laid-off union construction worker, Gonzalo Gonzalez came to the Career & Workforce Expectations Fair at Hobart High School in hopes of finding a job opportunity.\nHe left encouraged.\n\"I can definitely help him,\" said Kevin Comerford, representing Construction Advancement Foundation in Portage.\n... A laid-off union construction worker, Gonzalo Gonzalez came to the Career & Workforce Expectations Fair at Hobart High School in hopes of finding a job opportunity.\nHe left encouraged.\n\"I can definitely help him,\" said Kevin Comerford, representing Construction Advancement Foundation in Portage.\n... (Karen Caffarini) There were about 45 prospective employers at the event, including Chase Bank, BlueCross BlueShield, Illinois Department of Transportation and Chicago Cook Workforce Partnership, officials said.\nThe job fair was primarily targeting young people.\n\"Employers at this event were looking for both (full-time) and summer help right now,\" said Mary Paleologos, Kelly's district press secretary. \"They need workers, interns and apprentices. Meeting and talking with employers in person is always preferable to the anonymous process of applying online. When you meet an employer face-to-face, he or she can see your characteristics; recognize your intelligence, sales ability or level of motivation.\"\nBlue Cross Blue Shield is reaching out to the younger generation, according to L. Marie Asad, community relations coordinator for BlueCross BlueShield of Illinois.\n\"We post job openings on our twitter page, which is something young people use daily,\" Asad said. \"Today, we are encouraging young people to follow us on twitter and when they see a position they may be interested in, they can apply online.\"\nBlueCross BlueShield currently has 100 open positions, including volunteer opportunities.\n\"A great way for young people to get some experience under their belts is to take on a volunteer position,\" Asad said. \"Future employers will look at their volunteer jobs as really good experience when looking to enter the professional world.\"\nRebecca Ayiku, 15, of Dolton, agreed with Asad's point-of-view regarding volunteerism.\n\"Most jobs want you to at least be 16-years-old or even 18,\" Ayiku said. \"Volunteering is a way to get you in the door and for you to be able to get some hands-on job experience.\"\nHarris said the lack of more work experience has been a major hurdle in his job search.\n\"A lot of jobs out there are only being offered to people with experience, and as young people, we often don't have that experience,\" said Harris, who obtained his associate's degree from South Suburban College in South Holland after serving as a student trustee. \"Employers really need to take a chance on young people. We are hardworking and dedicated and will make excellent employees.\"\nHe said he didn't find a job at the fair.\nBut Harris said he plans to stay confident in his job search.\n\"If I see another job fair, I will go,\" Harris said. \"I will keep looking for full-time work.\"\nKelly White is a freelance reporter for the Daily Southtown.\nCopyright © 2016, Daily Southtown Job Fairs and Hiring Events Jobs and Workplace Colleges and Universities Unemployment and Layoffs Education Job Market Illinois Department of Transportation",

      "text": "VOL. 9 | NO. 17 | Saturday, April 23, 2016 \nThe Ledger Robots Are Taking Tennessee’s Jobs Here’s how the state is helping train the next generation to adapt SAM STOCKARD | The Ledger From (email): Message: \nMTSU student Nathan Simpkins found the perfect major when the university started its mechatronics engineering program in 2013, a pursuit practically guaranteeing him a high-paying job in an increasingly automated manufacturing industry. \nAnd once he graduates in May, Simpkins will be the prototype for the type of student manufacturers across Tennessee are trying to recruit, especially with old-fashioned and labor-intensive jobs falling by the wayside. \n“I just fell in love with all of it. It just clicked with me and it makes sense,” Simpkins says. “It’s fun. I get to tinker with robots and stuff.” \nWhen Simpkins, 22, graduated from Cheatham County High School and entered MTSU, he planned to focus on chemical engineering and transfer to an engineering school. Soon, though, he realized everything in chemistry was on a nanoscale – more theoretical – and he was a hands-on guy, having grown up on a farm in the Ashland City area. \n“I like the mechanical side, and I was also pretty good at programming, so when mechatronics came out, it all kind of fell into place at the right time,” he says. \nHe changed his major to mechatronics, a mixture of mechanical and electrical engineering nearly three years ago when MTSU introduced the program at the request of the Manufacturers Leadership Council, a Rutherford County-based group set up when companies began crying out for highly-trained specialists, especially in the engineering field, who could immediately impact local plants. \nMiddle Tennessee State University engineering students Nathan Simpkins, left, Tyler Ethington and John Sivilaylack work together to complete their Skittles Bot Project. \n(The Ledger/Michelle Morrow) \nSimpkins is the first and only MTSU student to take and pass the NCEES Fundamentals of Engineering Exam-Other Disciplines test, giving the university a 100 percent passing rate on the exam. \nA recent state report showed 1.4 million Tennessee jobs, many of them obsolete, labor positions, could be replaced by robots or machines in the next few years, affecting about half the state’s workforce. \nLynn Kreider, director of the Tennessee College of Applied Technology Murfreesboro, isn’t shocked by the report prepared by the Center for Economic Research in Tennessee. \nKreider, who will also oversee a TCAT in Smyrna being developed in conjunction with Nissan, says he’s been reading about similar studies for 20 years “and they just don’t come to fruition.” \nOn the other hand, Kreider says, Nissan and other manufacturers are already scooping up the college’s mechatronics graduates – the people who repair and program manufacturing robots – to the point he could graduate four times as many technicians and wouldn’t be able to catch up in 10 years. \nWith that in mind, Murfreesboro TCAT students Sean Turner and Dustin Howard are gearing up for job security in automation, programmable logic control or mechatronics, programs the 27 technical schools statewide are offering. \nBoth are nearing completion of industrial electrical maintenance certification at the college located just off Old Fort Parkway, where they say they’ve found a home to expand their knowledge. \n“I enjoy the field. It’s something different every day versus going to work and doing the same, repetitive motion,” says Turner, 26, a Nashville resident who works for Topre America, a Nissan sub-contractor investing $50 million in a stamping plant in Smyrna. \n“You can continue to learn up until the day you retire. That’s what I’m all about, trying to learn and have a better understanding.” \nHoward, 20, a Siegel High School graduate also nearing his certificate, echoes those words. “I’ve worked at jobs where it’s the same thing every day, and that gets kind of repetitive. I like learning, I like trying to find something new and new challenges. And I’ve heard it’s got great pay, and so that also kind of drug me to it.” \nThe biggest problem with this job trend is finding enough candidates to fill those positions. Officials say they’re battling everything from begrudging parents to poor math skills as they try to recruit students to these fields. \nConsequently, the desire to keep learning will put Turner and Howard at the front of the job market. \n“You have to be able to shift,” explains Turner, who will become a certified mechatronics technician upon graduation and would still like to enroll at MTSU to study engineering. \n“They’re gonna replace (labor jobs) with robots, and that’s where we come in. So I feel this is a safe field to be in for at least the next 20 to 30 years, a good field to retire from.” \nState outlook \nTennessee Economic and Community Development Commissioner Randy Boyd says the most recent report simply “reinforces what we thought might be coming.” \nJohn Sivilaylack works on cleaning up wiring for the groups robot project at MTSU. \n(The Ledger/Michelle Morrow) \nThree years ago, Republican Gov. Bill Haslam introduced the Drive to 55, an initiative to have 55 percent of Tennessee’s adults hold a post-secondary degree or certificate by 2025. They’ve modified the effort since then, introducing the Tennessee Promise, a scholarship covering tuition costs for qualifying students at community colleges and colleges of applied technology. \nThe most recent report comes on the heels of a similar study showing if Tennessee can move to 55 percent from today’s 37.3 percent for state residents with a degree or postsecondary certification, the extra value per year would total $9.3 billion worth of additional annual income, Boyd says. \nAt the same time, the state and local communities combined would make $730 million extra in revenue and taxes. \nTennessee isn’t much different from surrounding states in this regard, according to Boyd, explaining the Drive to 55 should make people realize how important it is for the state to succeed in the workforce evolution. \nBoyd acknowledges the state “definitely can be better” in producing more highly skilled students. \n“The great thing about Tennessee is we’ve spent the time to figure out what the cost and benefit is and, two, we’ve got the strategies around it. We don’t have everything, but we are making progress and we recognize the threat,” Boyd adds. \n“The most important thing to know is this is a real and present danger, a clear and present danger, and we need to be totally focused on making sure we solve it.” \nIn fall 2015, community colleges saw a 24.7 percent enrollment increase, largely as a result of Tennessee Promise. TCATs jumped 20 percent. \nGov. Haslam recently announced 82 percent of those students returned for this spring semester, including a 95 percent at the technical colleges. \n“Students must receive postsecondary credentials if we’re going to achieve the goal of Drive to 55, and we will continue to work with our campus leaders to ensure these students have the highest possible chances of attaining their certificate or degree,” Haslam says. \nWhile some say lottery funds used for the Tennessee Promise shouldn’t be diverted from Hope Scholarships, few, if any, members of the General Assembly will criticize the governor’s initiative because of its impact. \nDrive to 55 has five strategies, one involving alignment, an effort to make sure people are being trained for skills companies need. \nTennessee’s Labor and Education Alignment Program, forged by Sen. Mark Norris of Collierville, encourages and rewards community leaders, educators and businesses for working together to figure out where job skills gaps exist and then to fill them. \nThe state has spent $10 million on the program, and Haslam put another $10 million in his fiscal 2016-17 budget to make more LEAP (Labor Education Alignment Program) grants. \nIn addition, the Department of Economic and Community Development is charged with working alongside the Tennessee Board of Regents, University of Tennessee system and Department of Education to “make sure we’re aligned,” Boyd says. \nThe state’s colleges of applied technology already can adapt to changes in manufacturing quickly because of the relationships they have with businesses across Tennessee. \nAdvisory councils are set up with the TCATs and when industry change comes along, they can advise the college to shift its curriculum and even provide the equipment to train students for new methods, according to Boyd. \nCarl Mallette, professor and program coordinator at Pellissippi State Community College in Knoxville, says his students are being scooped up by East Tennessee manufacturers. \n(The Ledger/Chase Malone) \nSuch changes don’t move quite as fast in community colleges and four-year universities, but business and college officials are aware of the rapid changes in job technology, he notes. \nTaking it to another level \nWalter Boles , a professor in MTSU’s Engineering Technology Department, says there is a “huge need” to fill vacant positions, not because of a lack of job applicants but because those applying for jobs don’t have the right educational background for advanced manufacturing, high-technology jobs. \n“Due to strong demand and interest from our industry supporters of our department at MTSU, they requested we start a mechatronics engineering program, which we did,” he points out. \nMotlow State Community College, which has a mechatronics partnership with Warren County High School for dual enrollment, was already offering an associate’s degree in the field, and industry leaders wanted MTSU to be able to dovetail with that by setting up a four-year degree. \nIn its proposal to the Tennessee Board of Regents, MTSU said by year five it would have 50 fulltime students in the program. In year three, it already has 250 in the program, which is going through an accreditation process. \n“So that’s a good gauge of how popular this program is,” Boles says. \nJob placement is high, too, for graduating students and those entering graduate school. Salaries can range from $41,000 on the low end to $96,000 for an atypical student who already had five years of experience, according to Boles, who says graduates’ starting salaries are averaging in the mid-$60,000s. \nBoles says the Bridgestone America people informed him about 72 percent of its engineers will be eligible for retirement in three to five years. \n“So not only is there a severe shortage of people with engineering technology and engineering education, it’s only gonna get worse,” he says. \nIndustry steps in \nAllen Sherwood , who works for Bertelkamp Automation and heads up the Manufacturers Leadership Council in Rutherford County, bridges a gap between companies such as Nissan, General Mills and Vintec and MTSU, Motlow State and the College of Applied Technology to make sure they stay up to date with industry standards. \nThe industry has been driving toward automation for years but is trending toward a more rapid change with an increase in robotics, which are changing as well, he explains. \n“In order to compete with lower labor in other areas of the world you need to be able to have more sophisticated machinery, more automated machinery and then we want the students to be trained to that level,” Sherwood says. \n“The low-hanging labor jobs that are mundane and hard to do, those are the ones that are going to be targeted, and the lowest-paying jobs are going to automation.” \nPart of the council’s job is to take the message to the schools and let administrators, guidance counselors and teachers know “tremendous jobs” are available for someone with a two-year associate’s degree, four-year engineering degree or even a one-year certification from high school. \n“Manufacturing’s not what people think of, and career guidance counselors aren’t necessarily aware of all the jobs out there,” he says. \nThe council worked with Oakland High in Rutherford County to help it obtain mechatronics training equipment. Nearby Siegel High School is moving in the same direction, as well, along Smyrna High School, according to Sherwood. \nIn addition to talking with graduating seniors to let them know about the expanding market in manufacturing, the council does career days for eighth-graders as they make decisions on what high school path they might choose. \nThe council isn’t just concentrating on manufacturing. Health care providers are looking for people with industrial engineering skills. As a result, students with science, technology and math skills are in demand as well, Sherwood says. \n“The STEM-set skills are in all industries,” he says. \nOptimistic outlook \nChattanooga State Community College is taking the glass-half-full approach to the evolution of automated jobs and considers this an opportunity. \n“Yes, there may be manual jobs lost in the next 15 to 20 years, but it will create a whole new genre of skilled positions that will evolve out of that, everything from robotics to programming and program-logic controls and systems integration,” says Tim McGhee , in the college’s Engineering and Information Technologies Division. \nChattanooga State’s demand from advanced manufacturers is “off the chain,” he says, noting the division has 100 percent job placement. \nAs far as supply and demand, he admits the college could be doing better to meet the needs of local manufacturers. It works with Volkswagen and several of the primary suppliers and large manufacturers in the Chattanooga area. \nIn a strong economy, though, people are holding onto jobs, so Chattanooga State is relying on traditional students who recently graduated from high school to fill regional jobs. \nTelling a young person they can find a good career in advanced manufacturing can be difficult. But persuading parents is tougher, people who’ve worked in traditional manufacturing and don’t see it as a future for their children, he says. \n“So we’re kind of battling the culture of that aging workforce that was a legacy of old manufacturing, and I can say, here in Chattanooga and the needs of new and advanced manufacturing are still fighting that stigma, even though our graduates are coming out and making a whole lot more money than folks with baccalaureates,” McGhee adds. \nNancy Patterson , Chattanooga State vice president of college advancement and public relations, points out, however, non-traditional students, those who’ve been in the workplace for a while and want a second career or need to boost their skills, could be guaranteed a job if they enter one of Chattanooga State’s engineering technology or IT programs. \nThe governor’s Drive to 55 is important, she says, and Hamilton County is taking things even further with what’s called Chattanooga 2.0, which proposes for 75 percent of the county’s residents to hold a postsecondary certificate or degree by 2025. \n“So we’re going after this very aggressively in our community, and those adults who have some postsecondary credits but didn’t finish are one of our targets to encourage them to come back to finish their education in one of these high-demand skills,” Patterson says. \nTailored curriculum \nCarl Mallette, professor and program coordinator of the Electrical Engineering/Engineering Technology Office at Pellissippi State Community College in Knoxville, is seeing his students get scooped up by east state manufacturers. \n“So much more manufacturing’s coming in here, and we do not have trained people in the area to fill those jobs,” he says. \nOne problem with students who enter Pellissippi State is weak math skills, according to Mallette, and many of them stop coming to class and leave the college. The professor believes schools should prohibit calculators and put slide rules in students’ hands so they will learn the fundamentals of problem solving. \nThat shortfall aside, Pellissippi State collaborates with area companies such as Green Mountain Coffee, Alcoa and DENSO Manufacturing Tennessee in Maryville, which a year ago announced plans to add 500 jobs as part of a $400 million expansion project. \nIn fact, Pellissippi State designed a curriculum for DENSO, at the company’s request, combining its electrical engineering and industrial maintenance technology programs to come up with automated industrial systems to meet its needs, according to Mallette. \nAs a result, DENSO is hiring interns and grads from Pellissippi State, he says. \nRobotics and automation have been part of the DENSO plant since it opened a quarter-century ago, but those areas are expanding. The same is true with education and development, company officials say. \nIn addition to internal training for associates at the Maryville facility, where it produces electrical components for cars, fuel management systems and meters, DENSO partners with the Tennessee College of Applied Technology in Knoxville and Pellissippi State. The community college “tailored” its associate’s degree program to ensure it turned out the kind of employees DENSO needs, says Jeff Birkholz, section leader of DENSO’s Education and Development Department. \nDENSO also started working recently with Blount County and Knox County school systems to introduce mechatronics into their STEM and Career Technical Education programs, Birkholz adds. \nModern manufacturing facilities are replacing old factories, and sending that message to parents is “sometimes challenging,” says Bob Booker , senior manager of DENSO’s Corporate Services. But the company is seeing “strong interest” in mechatronics training from students entering area colleges. \nDENSO appreciates the state’s efforts on Drive to 55, which includes the Tennessee Promise of scholarship money for students to attend community colleges and technical schools. \nWhile some of the older plants pulled out of the state, Japanese companies such as Nissan and DENSO invested in facilities, sparking a rebirth of sorts and creating a ripple effect across the state. \n“I think that speaks real well, not only about the government cooperation at all levels within the state but just our workforce. We have really good people in Tennessee, and that means a lot to these companies that are moving in, to have this good workforce,” Booker says. \nLikewise, Hankook Tire America Corp . is constructing a major manufacturing facility in Clarksville and recently announced it will move its North America headquarters to Nashville, investing $5 million and creating up to 200 jobs in Davidson County. \n“Hankook Tire could choose anywhere to locate its North American headquarters, and it says volumes about Davidson County and Tennessee that they chose us,” says Boyd, the state’s Economic and Community Development commissioner. \nThe South Korean-owned company is not concerned about Tennessee’s ability to turn out enough skilled workers. In fact, Hankook took the workforce and availability of skilled employees into consideration when looking for the places to put its plant and headquarters, according to company spokesman Henry Kopacz. \n“That’s not an issue at all. In fact, that’s one reason why Hankook is in Tennessee now,” Kopacz says. \nNissan partnership \nOne of the most important developments for College of Applied Technology in Tennessee is still under construction across from the Nissan’s plant, where a $35 million training center is set to open later this year. \nNissan and TCAT Murfreesboro will occupy the facility jointly to turn out graduates who will be able to work in Nissan’s Tennessee manufacturing operations, with one of its suppliers or with another company. \n“Nissan’s success in Tennessee for more than 30 years is due in large part to our ability to recruit and retain a quality workforce of more than 12,000 employees working at the company’s operations in Smyrna, Franklin and Decherd,” Jose Munoz , executive vice president of Nissan Motor Ltd., and chairman of Nissan North America, said shortly after breaking ground on the facility last year. \n“This new training center is a key component to the long-term sustainability and continued growth of our business in Tennessee and another testament to the state’s commitment to advancing business through education.” \nNissan officials say they remain committed to developing and maintaining a highly skilled workforce in Middle Tennessee. \nIn its relationship with Nissan, TCAT Murfreesboro is being supplied with more than a dozen robots for student training. A governor’s grant from two years ago and donated equipment from local companies enabled it to upgrade equipment. \nThe automation at companies such as Nissan, Vi-Jon personal care products and Amazon is “amazing,” TCAT Murfreesboro’s Kreider says. \n“But like I say, we’re pretty much insulated because we’re the ones who create the guys who work on the stuff that’s automated,” Kreider says. “So as long as they keep building it, there’s gotta be someone to fix it.” \nSam Stockard can be reached at . \nSign-Up For Our Free Email Edition Get the news first with our daily email Name",

      "text": "  Lagos \nBy Moses Nosike \nFollowing several challenges emerging from recruitment process in Nigeria, beginning from poor CV preparation and school curriculum system that have affected many Nigerian graduates securing jobs and as well competing favourably globally, employme.ng, an online HR firm which builds network of employable professionals and also keen in protecting them in the job market has been preparing and repositioning Nigerian job seekers for gainful employments through its trained network of employable professional scheme. \nHead of Talents, employme.ng, Christian Anozie said, “What we are trying to do is get a pool of employable Nigerians that would be ready and easily available for quick hire for companies – SMEs, entrepreneurs, Blue chips, NGOs etc. in whatever capacity, be it part/full time, internship, adhoc, volunteering for specific projection and endeavours and then be a consultant on short term, medium or long term hire. www.employme.ng projects employable Nigerians for SMEs engagement thereby easing hiring processes for small firms. \n“We target people who for one form or the other, the competitive labour market will make them not easily be seen for employment, so we evaluate them and decide suitable professional approach to help them fit both national and international. So, we invite them, look at their CV’s and interview them using global best practices in Human Resources. When we see their CV’s we now have first hand interviews with them. Thereafter, their qualification level would determine if we can put them on our online platform for employment or make recommendations for more improvement. It is a holistic approach that has achieved results both home and abroad. \nHowever, the reason for the online platform is because most of the youths are always on social media, so we send out messages on social media. We have also done newspaper adverts, introduced our website to all the various media platforms, because that is where most of them submit their CV. We also reached out to National Youth Service Corps and other higher institutions in Lagos, as we educate students on where they can secure IT and holiday employment and are able to give their best to organizations while garnering experience even before they leave school. \nAgain, we decided to launch online because 60% to 70% of employer- employee engagement are done first online and that is the new direction of business, so virtual HR has come to stay. So we have to be at the media space so that organizations looking for them can get them online since that is the easiest place to get ready workforce. For Entrepreneurs’ and SMEs looking at credible Nigerians to employ, the method is easy, just go to the website, based on the profession, you look up at the list of people in that profession which we have evaluated and we feel they can give their best based on the global best practices in human resources.",

She said she and classmate Gracie Perez were looking for jobs as certified nursing assistants and visited several booths. \n\"We liked all of them,\" Ochoa said, adding that she is interested in getting a summer job to help her save for college. \nOchoa is seeking a career as a pediatric surgeon. Perez said she plans to be a registered nurse. \nJustin Coats and Josh Cole, classmates in ICTC's auto mechanics, wore coats and ties as they walked along aisles of vendors. \n\"You've got to look good if you want a good job, someone to hire you,\" said Coats, a Fort Gibson High School senior. \nCole, a Porter High School senior, said he talked with several vendors and was interested in the National Guard. \nVendors included representatives of the armed forces, colleges, health care providers, businesses and manufacturers. \n\"We wanted to get out and meet students and let them know we want to open our door to students and future employees,\" said Darrin Smith, vice president of human resources and safety for Griffin Foods. \nSmith said Griffin offers opportunities for internships in food safety, as well as part time employment. \nMuskogee's Gospel Rescue Mission even had a booth. \n\"We are hoping youth will come join us as volunteers or staffing to help the community,\" said Executive Director Rich Schaus. He said the mission is seeking a staff member to help encourage clients. \nICTC Superintendent Tony Pivec said Friday's career fair was \"one of our best turnouts ever.\" \n\"One of the students was telling a teacher he had to go back to the classroom to print out more resumes,\" Pivec said. \nHe praised ICTC job placement specialist D'Amber D. Desmuke Bunch for setting up the fair. \n\"She focused on employers that matched programs we have,\" he said. \nA career fair is set for May 6 at ICTC's Tahlequah campus. \nReach Cathy Spaulding at (918) 684-2928 or .

Seniors from Glasgow, Caverna and Glasgow Christian Academy toured Wednesday. Barren County seniors toured Thursday. \nJames Brown / Glasgow Daily Times editor's pick featured Students tour Barren County industries, learn about local jobs By JAMES BROWN jbrown@glasgowdailytimes.com 19 hrs ago Glasgow High Schools students tour Amneal Pharmaceuticals on Wednesday as Mike Smith, the human resource director for Glasgow, talks to them about what job opportunities are available. Seniors from Glasgow, Caverna and Glasgow Christian Academy toured Wednesday. Barren County seniors toured Thursday. \nJames Brown / Glasgow Daily Times \nLevi Shaw learned his preconception of local industrial facilities is not reality. \n“The factories were a lot cleaner than I thought they were,” the Glasgow Christian Academy senior said Wednesday. \nShaw was among 178 seniors from GCA, Glasgow High School and Caverna High School who toured industry facilities and T.J. Samson Community Hospital in Barren County on Wednesday. Another 275 seniors from Barren County High School did the tours Thursday. \nShaw was among two waves of students who visited Akebono Brake’s facility on Cleveland Avenue and Amneal Pharmaceuticals on Beaver Trail. The first wave Wednesday at Amneal was comprised of Glasgow seniors. They heard stories from employees about what it takes to make it in today’s manufacturing workforce and what hiring professionals want in employees. \nThe pharmaceutical facility is primarily a distribution center, but within there are sales team positions, internet technology jobs and even corporate-level supply chain jobs where the employee is based in Glasgow. \nMatt Beals was the latter. \n“I started with Amneal working summers while in school,” Beals told the more than 20 Glasgow students gathered in the employee break room at the facility. “I enjoyed it. I had the attitude that I was going to work hard. I didn’t want people to think that just because it was a summer job that I wasn’t going to work hard.” \nHe graduated from the University of Kentucky with a degree in secondary education social studies, but decided that field was not for him and he returned to Amneal with a full-time position in drug supply chain security. \nDakota Walden came to work at Amneal not long after graduating high school and has moved up from a warehouse floor employee to a warehouse supervisor in two years. \n“I want the best for myself. You don’t get to that point by hanging back,” Walden said. “You’ve got to be the person who says, ‘I’ll do that.’” \nWalden said he planned to be a machinist, but has found what he considers to be a better path for himself. \n“I thought I was going to work in a machine shop the rest of my life,” he said. \nMike Smith, the Amneal human resources representative in Glasgow, told the students work ethic, appearance and self-motivation are key to being hired for a job and being successful once a person is employed. \n“I want someone who can carry themselves,” he said. \nMorgan Atwell, 20, is someone who can carry herself, Smith said. \nAtwell wanted a position in the warehouse and has impressed her supervisors with her work ethic and desire to do the job well. \n“I was brought up to work hard. When you work hard for a company, they will recognize it,” she said. “It follows you and they remember that.” \nOn Thursday, Regan Taylor and some of her Barren County senior classmates toured Akebono Brake and were impressed by what they saw in the facility and the impact it has beyond the boundaries of their home county. \n“I did not know that it shipped all over the world and that Glasgow, Kentucky impacted the world so much,” she said. \n“I really liked the part about how they make the calipers for the vehicles,” Nichole Wilcher said. “I really liked that part because it makes me think of how I can work on my own trucks on my own and maybe get a job here after I graduate high school. \n“ I really liked it. It made me think of how I need to get a job after I graduate and make my own money to support myself, and not only myself, but whoever I wind up with.” \nThe industry tours are part of a combined effort of Industrial Development Economic Authority of Glasgow-Barren County, Western Kentucky University-Glasgow and Southcentral Kentucky Community and Technical College and others to expand workforce development in Barren County. \nBarren County Judge-Executive Micheal Hale has also been involved in the development of workforce through his roles at the state, regional and local level of workforce development boards. \nHe provided surveys to the students Wednesday for their feedback on how effective the tours had been at informing them about employment opportunities in the community. \n“We want your input on how today was for you and so that we can make it better for next year,” Hale said during a debrief in the Glasgow High School auditorium. \nShaw said prior to receiving the survey that he has no plans of applying for any of the industry jobs, but, “I know of people that it would be good for them, especially (the opportunity) for different careers.” Sign Up / Sign In With your existing account from... {* loginWidget *}",

      "text": "© 2016 North Jersey Media Group April 24, 2016 Last updated: Sunday, April 24, 2016, 1:21 AM Small businesses look to improve benefits and job security By JANE M. VON BERGEN THE PHILADELPHIA INQUIRER | The Record \nPHILADELPHIA — When a blizzard blankets a customer's business, making entrance impossible, when a fallen tree blocks a driveway, when leaves or ice clog a drain, flooding the parking lot, landscaper Bob Keller wants to be there for his customers. \nWhich is why Keller said he decided to invest more in his employees by offering 401(k) retirement plans to the full-time employees of his Philadelphia-area small business, R.P. Keller Landscaping Inc. \n\"It's job security for them and for me,\" said Keller, 38, who employs six to eight people full time year-round and more seasonally. \nKeller's decision comes as the federal government and some states, including New Jersey, where he's based, are looking to encourage small businesses like Keller's to provide retirement savings programs to employees. \nJersey's law, signed in January, will create a retirement savings marketplace enabling employers to establish such plans. Laws like it are being considered around the country as the burden of financing retirement has shifted from employers, through pensions, to their staff. \nBut many employees, especially those paid less, have no retirement savings, according to a U.S. Federal Reserve report released last May. Four in 10 of those surveyed have given little or no thought to retirement and fewer than a third have savings. \nNationally, 22 percent of companies like Keller's — with fewer than 10 employees — provide retirement plans, according to a Pew Charitable Trusts report released in January. \nBy contrast, three in four employees of companies with 500 or more workers have access to retirement plans. \n\"It's not hard to grasp,\" Keller said. \"Health care, vacation pay, time-and-a-half over 40 hours. It leads to employment longevity and stability. \n\"What they invest in the company\" and serving customers, he said, \"they can get it back.\" \nPew's review of federal data finds that 49 percent of the nation's workers in the analysis participate in a workplace retirement savings program, with 58 percent having access. \nAmong those shut out are independent contractors working in the so-called gig economy and workers who cobble together part-time jobs. \n\"It's a concern that people have adequate retirement savings,\" said Richard McHugh, vice president of the Plan Sponsor Council of America, an advocacy group for organizations and companies that offer work-based retirement plans to employees. \nDan Hernandez, a certified financial planner who represents Lincoln Investment Inc., a Philadelphia-area broker-dealer, says he's seeing more interest in 401(k) plans from small-business clients, who tend to have a protective attitude toward employees. \nA 401(k) plan allows workers to save for retirement with a pre-tax payroll deduction that is funneled to a financial services company, which invests it. As a benefit, some employers match a portion of the deduction, amounting to more compensation, which is also not taxed. \nHernandez said some clients may be offering 401(k) plans because they're less expensive than health insurance. \n\"You can put your employee in a [401(k)] plan and offer them a match of 3 percent of their salary, which is infinitely less than offering health insurance,\" Hernandez said. \nAssuming someone earning $50,000 contributes 3 percent, the employer's 401(k) match would equal $1,500, compared to $5,000 — the average employer contribution for health insurance for one employee, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation's annual survey. \nEven as officials work to raise participation in retirement savings plans, the youngest workers aren't that interested, concludes a December survey by the Employee Benefit Research Institute. \nMillennial workers tend not to know about benefits, including retirement, or care about them, EBRI's study shows. \nMany would rather have the money and buy health insurance or save for retirement on their own. \nHernandez said that part of his job is educating his clients' employees. \nThey aren't aware of the advantages of a pre-tax 401(k) program and may not appreciate the value of employers' matching part of workers' contributions. \n\"Often they are living paycheck to paycheck and without being experienced in the stock market, they hear the market is going down, it scares them away,\" Hernandez said. \nBut he said if the employer matches dollar for dollar, that's a 100 percent return on their money. \nMcHugh said the millennials' perceived lack of interest may actually be lack of money. Many are so saddled with student debt that they can't afford to save for retirement. \nWhether employees participate, state and federal governments are trying to increase access. Governor Christie signed a law Jan 19 creating the New Jersey Small Business Retirement Marketplace. \nModeled on health insurance markets established by the federal Affordable Care Act, New Jersey's marketplace will consist of individual retirement account plans offered by financial service companies and vetted by the state treasurer. \nThey will be available, on a voluntary basis, to employers with 100 or fewer workers. \nPresident Obama's 2017 budget proposal includes increased tax credits, up to $1,500 per company, per year, for three years, for small employers that add retirement plans. The credits are intended to offset initial costs to set up and administer the plans. \nAnother proposal would allow small firms to join multiple employer plans, providing administrative efficiency and savings through scale. \nEmployers in the same industry can now join together to set up these plans, but not firms in unrelated fields.",

        "title": "Clark students speak out about undocumented status, DACA policy \nMA_Worcester_Telegram WORCESTER – Rodrigo Saavedra and Nathanael S. Aragon Cooper have come a long way from the situations their families left two decades ago. But as they’re frequently reminded by their country’s government – and some of the people who seek to run it – they haven’t come far enough.\nMr. Saavedra and Mr. Aragon Cooper, both 22 and seniors at Clark University, have been living in the U.S. undocumented since they were brought here 18 and 20 years ago, respectively. The controversial program that’s given them hope for their futures in America, meanwhile – the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, policy – hangs in the balance, as the Supreme Court weighs a state’s challenge to a proposed expansion of the policy.\nInitially proposed by President Barack Obama four years ago as an executive order, DACA is intended to address, albeit temporarily, the plights of undocumented immigrants such as Mr. Saavedra and Mr. Aragon Cooper who were too young at the time to have any real say in their immigration to the U.S. The program grants undocumented residents who entered the country before their 16th birthday and before June 2007 a renewable two-year work permit, and spares them from deportation.\nIn 2012, Mr. Obama announced an expansion to the original policy that would have changed the cutoff for the year of arrival to 2010 and eliminated the existing age requirement. He also proposed DACA’s sister policy, the Deferred Action for Parents of Americans program, which extends DACA’s protections to undocumented immigrant parents of U.S. citizens or otherwise legal residents.\nBut Texas and other states subsequently sued to prevent both programs from going forward, leading to a federal court injunction that has temporarily halted their implementation, and landed the case before the Supreme Court. The eight-justice panel held oral arguments on Monday and is expected to deliver a decision either next month or in June.\nEva Millona, executive director of the Massachusetts Immigrant and Refugee Advocacy Coalition, was one of thousands of immigration advocates who took part in a rally in Washington, D.C., on Monday outside of the Supreme Court.\n“It was quite powerful, to listen to the families, to listen to their stories, and to hear their eagerness,” she said. “Really their only chance is to win this case.”\nWhile it’s not the permanent, legislative immigration reform the group has long been hoping for, MIRA is “extremely supportive of the president’s orders,” Ms. Millona added. “It at least provides a legal path for people (to stay in the country), even if it’s temporary.\n“We know it’s a Band-Aid solution, and it’s not what we really want. But this is the first step in fixing part of (the immigration system).”\nOn the other end of the political spectrum, however, opponents of DACA and DAPA have decried what they see as Mr. Obama’s overstepping the laws of the land, and single-handedly ruling on an issue that should be left to Congress.\n“I think even people who support the president’s objectives should be concerned about the precedent this could set,” said Ira Mehlman, a representative of the Federation for American Immigration Reform.\nIn addition, from a policy standpoint, Mr. Obama’s orders “essentially remove any meaningful restriction on immigration to the United States,” he said. “It undermines the (nation’s) whole immigration policy.”\nFor DACA specifically, the losers would appear to be millennial Americans, Mr. Mehlman argues, who are now suddenly faced with even more competition from undocumented immigrants in an already meager job market for new graduates.\nMr. Saavedra and Mr. Aragon Cooper have heard those arguments, as well as the rhetoric from presidential candidates like Republican Donald Trump, who infamously branded illegal immigrants as rapists in a speech last year. But like many beneficiaries of DACA, they’re not sure where else they’re supposed to go.\n“I feel American in every way, except in the way the American government defines,” said Mr. Aragon Cooper, whose mother fled with him from Mexico and a dangerous domestic situation. “I feel like people shouldn’t listen to the rhetoric, and get to know the people in their communities.”\nFor both him and Mr. Saavedra, the realities of their situations as undocumented residents set in during their junior year of high school, a time when the rest of their classmates were “getting jobs, getting driver’s permits – you realized you couldn’t have those things,” Mr. Aragon Cooper said.\nBattling depression, he said “it was grinding just to have to go to school. In the back of your head, you thought, ‘This might just be a waste of time.’ ”\nBoth he and Mr. Saavedra, whose family fled their native Peru, ultimately credit their networks of support – friends and family, as well as immigration activists – with helping them overcome their status and go to college. DACA, meanwhile, has given them a chance to work, as well. Mr. Saavedra, for instance, has been able to work at a legal firm in Boston under the program.\n“It’s opened up opportunities I otherwise would not have had,” said Mr. Aragon Cooper, who hopes to enroll in medical school after graduation, although his status will continue to hinder his chances to receive financial aid.\nTheir situations are not rare in the region, according to Clark University political science professor Heather Silber Mohamed, who cited recent Migration Policy Institute data estimating around 13,000 undocumented immigrants in the Worcester area would be affected by DACA and DAPA. She also said most citizens are largely in favor of those immigrants staying in the U.S., according to recent polling.\n“What we’ve seen really consistently over time is a majority of Americans support a path to citizenship,” she said, adding there has also been a corresponding drop in the number of people who believe all illegal immigrants should be deported.\n“I think the issue of immigration is cyclical – it’s come up throughout history,” Mr. Saavedra said. “Changes (to America’s immigration system) may be slow and piecemeal, but I’m very hopeful we’ll see immigration reform happen.”\nYoung undocumented people like Mr. Saavedra and Mr. Aragon Cooper are playing an increasingly important role in that process, according to Ms. Millona, who credited them for being “very vocal, in terms of their advocacy … they have brought their human stories to the picture.”\nMr. Saavedra, who said he is involved in immigration activism, pointed out DACA has given him a relative safe position from which to speak out. But he was also talking about being an undocumented resident when he was in high school, before Mr. Obama’s order was in effect.\n“In the media, (our message) gets muddled, misinterpreted, or straight up ignored at times,” he said. “And (speaking out) might put me at risk.

      "text": "WORCESTER – Rodrigo Saavedra and Nathanael S. Aragon Cooper have come a long way from the situations their families left two decades ago. But as they’re frequently reminded by their country’s government – and some of the people who seek to run it – they haven’t come far enough. Mr. Saavedra and Mr. Aragon Cooper, both 22 and seniors at Clark University, have been living in the U.S. undocumented since they were brought here 18 and 20 years ago, respectively. The controversial program that’s given them hope for their futures in America, meanwhile – the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, policy – hangs in the balance, as the Supreme Court weighs a state’s challenge to a proposed expansion of the policy. Initially proposed by President Barack Obama four years ago as an executive order, DACA is intended to address, albeit temporarily, the plights of undocumented immigrants such as Mr. Saavedra and Mr. Aragon Cooper who were too young at the time to have any real say in their immigration to the U.S. The program grants undocumented residents who entered the country before their 16th birthday and before June 2007 a renewable two-year work permit, and spares them from deportation. In 2012, Mr. Obama announced an expansion to the original policy that would have changed the cutoff for the year of arrival to 2010 and eliminated the existing age requirement. He also proposed DACA’s sister policy, the Deferred Action for Parents of Americans program, which extends DACA’s protections to undocumented immigrant parents of U.S. citizens or otherwise legal residents. But Texas and other states subsequently sued to prevent both programs from going forward, leading to a federal court injunction that has temporarily halted their implementation, and landed the case before the Supreme Court. The eight-justice panel held oral arguments on Monday and is expected to deliver a decision either next month or in June. Eva Millona, executive director of the Massachusetts Immigrant and Refugee Advocacy Coalition, was one of thousands of immigration advocates who took part in a rally in Washington, D.C., on Monday outside of the Supreme Court. “It was quite powerful, to listen to the families, to listen to their stories, and to hear their eagerness,” she said. “Really their only chance is to win this case.” While it’s not the permanent, legislative immigration reform the group has long been hoping for, MIRA is “extremely supportive of the president’s orders,” Ms. Millona added. “It at least provides a legal path for people (to stay in the country), even if it’s temporary. “We know it’s a Band-Aid solution, and it’s not what we really want.

Giving Hope, a nonprofit, advocates for and assists people who are homeless or at risk of becoming homeless. \nOn Jan. 21, about 50 volunteers helped conduct the survey, which estimates the number of homeless and assesses their needs. The survey identified nearly 230 people who are homeless in Denton. \nOf those, 25.7 percent said they hold down full-time jobs. Yet they’re still unable to draw enough income for an application fee, deposit and upfront rent to move into an apartment, officials say. \n“That’s always a shock … the people who [are] homeless, they have a full-time job, but it’s just not enough to get them three times the rent they need to get into an apartment,” said Alonzo Peterson, executive director of Giving Hope. “People just assume that they’re homeless and not working.” \nIt’s even more difficult for those with a criminal record to find a landlord who will rent to them, he said. \nAbout 70 percent of the people surveyed said they are able to work. Nearly 53 percent were unemployed and looking for work. But, Peterson said, it’s extremely difficult to find work when you have to haul all your belongings to a job interview, or don’t have reliable access to a phone or email to follow up with employers. \nThe survey indicates that six months is the median length of unemployment. \nSince the last Point-in-Time survey, the numbers have remained relatively the same. In 2015, the survey found 234 people in Denton who identified themselves as homeless. \nThe Texas Homeless Network, an Austin-based organization that offers solutions for ending homelessness in the state, uses a formula to determine the annual estimated homeless and transient population living in each county. In 2014, the organization reported an estimated 1,600 homeless and transient people lived in Denton County. The 2016 estimate was unavailable Thursday night. \nMore and more people are homeless longer now than in previous years, Peterson said. \nThe largest contributing factors to homelessness locally include substance abuse, financial reasons, unemployment and health issues, according to the survey. \nPoint-in-Time counts are taken around the country over a 24-hour period in January. Volunteers visit areas where homeless people congregate, focusing on shelters because that’s where most people are expected to be during cold weather. \nThe counts offers a snapshot of the homeless population on the day the survey was taken. The data is analyzed and used for planning purposes to tackle homelessness. The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development requires the Point-in-Time count for counties that receive federal funding. \nPeterson said the local data will soon be analyzed and compared with data from 2015. \nOn Thursday, city and school officials, hospital representatives and church ministry leaders attended the State of the Homeless seminar, which lasted more than two hours. \nA separate presentation, given by Christy Daniel, a social worker with youth advocacy group Journey to Dream, shed light on the number of homeless youths in Denton County. \nMore than 2,000 children in Denton County were reported homeless during the 2014-15 school year, Daniel told seminar attendees. About 400 of the children were high school students. \nAbout 70 percent were living in hotels, staying in cars or sleeping on someone’s couch, while the other 30 percent were on the streets, she said. \nShe said 46 percent of the youths left home because of abusive situations, and 40 percent were kicked out or abandoned because of their sexual identity. \nDaniel said nearly 1 in 7 youths between ages 10 and 18 run away at least once, and of those, 70 percent leave home spontaneously with no plan. \nJourney to Dream intends to open Kyle’s Place, a shelter for unaccompanied homeless youths, this September in Lewisville, she said. \nCourtney Cross, United Way of Denton County’s community impact coordinator for homelessness initiatives, discussed the Denton County Homelessness Leadership Team during Thursday’s seminar. \nThe oversight committee of 15 to 20 members will begin meeting next month and will be tasked with looking at ways to address homelessness and housing services. The effort is funded by the United Way and the city of Denton. \n\nBRITNEY TABOR can be reached at 940-566-6876 and via Twitter at @BritneyTabor. \nBRITNEY TABOR can be reached at 940-566-6876 and via Twitter at @BritneyTabor.",

      "text": "by , Marysville Globe Managing Editor Today at 6:00AM MARYSVILLE – Who says kids don’t want jobs and responsibility? Sunnyside Elementary School students thrive on it. Even first-graders have jobs there – as greeters at the front door. Dallas Mewbourn, a third-grader, helps her younger co-workers. She admitted some days she doesn’t feel like being friendly and smiling, but she does it anyway, “because it’s my job.” New principal Brynn Markum said the jobs have really helped students’ self-esteem, and thereby improved behavior at the school. Because there are no sidewalks around the school, all 530 students take the bus. They are dropped off 15 minutes before school starts, which led to behavior problems for many students. So staff there decided to give kids something to do. They came up with dozens of jobs, students looked at the job descriptions and applied. Some students were recruited for jobs. The responsibility of having jobs also has improved attendance. “It’s meaningful work,” the principal said. Fifth-grader Lindsay Bootsma has excelled reading with the school’s youngest kids. “I help kids read, and they point to the pictures,” she said. “I like kids but sometimes they’re crazy.” Markum added that Lindsay reads so much that she has 230 points, compared with most students around 80, in a school competition. Other jobs include: holiday artist, lost and found, garbage crew, hallway monitor and lunch cart return. Along with the jobs, the school also offers various activities to keep kids busy before school. There is a running club, homework club, computer lab, library time, food service, etc. “It’s really powerful,” Markum said. “It makes them feel like they are a member of something.” The afternoon before, she and many of her staff talked with the board at a work session about the jobs. “We open the doors before school before the bell even rings, and it makes students want to be there,” Markum said. Pride Print stickers are awarded, and there are prizes such as donuts and popcorn. Another popular program at the school is called Watch Dogs. Markum said they are father figures for many of the students. She said surveys show kids with a man in their life are twice as likely to graduate from high school. The dads stay at school all day, and are kept busy. “Dads are exhausted,” by the end of the day, Markum said. Students also are given a voice at the school, she added, such as getting to name the school mascot, which is also a job. Teachers also have bought in to changes at the school. To try to close the achievement gap they have common planning time. About 80 percent of teachers took a CPR-First Aid class together. Using computer programs they are able to provide differentiated instruction to challenge all students. Scores have improved in math and English. “You have the systems in place” to help students succeed,” school board president Pete Lundberg said.",

      "text": "The Canadian Press April 24, 2016 - 8:00am \nCALGARY — Shady Hashem travelled part way around the world to study as a mine engineer in Canada, at times paying triple the local tuition and working at a call centre to put himself through school, only to graduate in one of the worst job markets in recent memory. \n\"There's no jobs,\" says Hashem, 28. \n\"I talk to a lot of engineers, and the expected time to get a job is between six months and a year.\" \nHe came to Calgary to look for work after finishing classes at Halifax's Dalhousie University in December, hoping to find something in Alberta's oilsands with his co-op work experience at Syncrude last summer. But postings are slim, and he hasn't heard anything back after applying for 50 or so jobs in recent weeks. \n\"I'm applying everywhere, but I haven't heard back from anybody yet, not even an email that says: 'Sorry, this position has been filled,'\" said Hashem. \"That's very frustrating.\" \nHashem, originally from Egypt but now a permanent resident of Canada, is one of the many recent engineering grads who are struggling to find jobs as the oil-and-gas industry continues to slash jobs in the aftermath of the global oil price plunge. \nThose still in school looking for work experience also face a daunting market as summer approaches. \nColleen Bangs, manager of career services at the University of Calgary, says only about a third of the 659 engineering students at the school have found placements for their year-long internships as companies cut back on campus recruitment. \n\"Something I've noticed, particularly in this last semester, is that there's a bit of an impending feeling of doom,\" said Bangs. \nThat's in stark contrast to the situation just a couple years ago, when the industry was booming. \n\"It was just a very different climate. Employers were racing to make offers,\" said Bangs. \"Whereas now it's a bit more sombre to be totally honest. It's a lot slower, much like we're seeing in the general marketplace.\" \nSeveral companies are cutting back on student hirings. Suncor says it's reduced hiring compared with recent years without giving specifics, while Cenovus Energy says it isn't hiring any students at all for now, paid or unpaid. \nCenovus spokesman Brett Harris said in an email that the company suspended the program given the challenging economic environment, which has resulted in more than 30 per cent of the company's overall workforce being cut since the end of 2014. \nIt's not all doom and gloom, however. \nAt the University of Alberta, close to 70 per cent of the 1,300 students looking for four-month co-op placements have found them, said assistant professor Tim Joseph at the university's school of mining and petroleum engineering. \nHe said employers still have short-term hiring needs — and while the co-op students are paid a healthy salary ranging from around $3,000 to over $6,000 a month at times, companies aren't on the hook for senior-level salaries, benefits or other long-term obligations. \n\"It's not the same expense as a full hire. You can normally get two to three people for the price of one,\" said Joseph. \nJoseph said he's hoping to get over 80 per cent of students in co-ops this summer, compared with a peak of 96 per cent in the boom years. Students who can't find placements risk losing their spot in the co-op program, and graduating without crucial work experience. \nBut even those graduating with experience are struggling, said Joseph, as they look for those elusive long-term, full-time jobs. He recently asked for a show of hands in the graduating class of about 850 of those who had a job lined up, and said only about 20 per cent raised their hands. \nHashem was fortunate enough to find co-op placements throughout his program so has some savings to live off, but he's cut back on expenses where he can. \nWith few jobs to apply for, he's spending most of his time these days trying to further improve his skills, taking an online course on project manager principles so he can apply for civil engineering jobs. \nHe says he has up days and down days as he tries to stay focused and optimistic. \n\"I'm doing my best,\" he said. \"I'm improving my qualifications, but I'm still waiting.\" \n———",

      "text": "This is a classic example of why the media is out of touch. The jobs described in this article are not \"middle class,\" they are, if anything, \"working class.\" Yes, repititious jobs are disappearing because they can be done more efficiently by machines and computers but there are thousands of jobs that don't require a college degree but employers are using a degree as a weeding out factor. I worked for almost 40 years in the aviation industry, including about half that time for two major corporations as a corporate pilot. I spent 12 years in the military and did not have a college degree, nor did most of my fellow pilots. Now, its almost impossible for a young pilot to get a job without a degree, not because a degree makes anyone a better pilot, but because there are a lot of pilots with degrees of some sort and HR people (who are degreed) have been conditioned to give degrees more weight than they should. Of course, that's because that's what they were taught in college. The real problem is academia - they have created degrees for professions and skills that really don't require a degree. (BTW, two of my children have masters degrees, including one from Harvard, but that doesn't make them any more suited for most jobs than if they didn't have one.) This all started in the 60s when Congress started providing student loans and grants and colleges saw an opportunity to bring in more revenue so they came up with new degrees.",

      "text": "Canyon State Bus Sales Brings New Jobs, Economic Benefits to Local Community PRWeb \nAn exclusive Blue Bird dealership, Canyon State Bus Sales celebrates new facility, alternative fuel focus in Glendale. Glendale, Arizona (PRWEB) April 25, 2016 \nSchool bus sales and service authority Canyon State Bus Sales opened the doors to a new facility on April 20th with a ribbon-cutting attended by Glendale Mayor Jerry Weiers and other local dignitaries. \nThe 27,500-square-foot facility was developed from the ground up by Canyon State and allows the company to increase its staff by 15 percent immediately. This first building owned by the company is 60 percent larger than the company’s previous headquarters in Phoenix. The move to Glendale is a milestone for Canyon State, which has seen rising interest in its propane autogas fueled buses. “This new location offers us efficiencies and growth opportunities to better serve our customers, particularly with the significant increase of propane buses that we’ve sold in the past three years,” said Phil Polizzatto, president of Canyon State, an exclusive Blue Bird dealer. \nLast month the company supplied Kyrene School District in Tempe with 73 Blue Bird Vision Propane buses . Adding propane autogas fueled buses allows Arizona’s school districts to operate quieter buses that are more comfortable for drivers and students, and that significantly reduce harmful emissions to improve community air quality. \nStarted in 2004, Canyon State has expanded to become the largest provider of student transportation in the state of Arizona. As part of the move to the new facility, Canyon State hired six additional employees and will continue to increase its staff. The new facility will also allow the company to expand into other areas of transportation, such as shuttle and commercial buses. \n\"It continues to be an exciting time at Blue Bird with new product announcements and significant growth. Today our valued dealer, Canyon States, opens a new facility to support that growth and to provide the best customer experience in the market,\" said John Kwapis, chief operating officer, Blue Bird Corporation, speaking at the opening ceremony. Steve Girardin, president of Micro Bird, also attended the ceremony. \n“One of my favorite sayings is ‘here we grow again’ and I’m so pleased to utilize that statement for this business, in particular because of the people involved in making it happen,” said Glendale Mayor Weiers. “I want to thank Phil Polizzatto and his entire team at Canyon State Bus Sales for moving their business to Glendale. I specifically mentioned this business in my recent “State of the City Address” because, as a former business owner, I understand what goes into these decisions, as well as the incredible impact it has on a community. On behalf of our city, I welcome Canyon State Bus, an award-winning business that is clearly best-in-class, and wish them all the success in the world.” The new building is located at 5600 West Claremont Street in Glendale. \nAbout Blue Bird Corporation Blue Bird is the leading independent designer and manufacturer of school buses, with more than 550,000 buses sold since its formation in 1927 and approximately 180,000 buses in operation today. Blue Bird’s longevity and reputation in the school bus industry have made it an iconic American brand. Blue Bird distinguishes itself from its principal competitors by its singular focus on the design, engineering, manufacture and sale of school buses and related parts. As the only manufacturer of chassis and body production specifically designed for school bus applications, Blue Bird is recognized as an industry leader for school bus innovation, safety, product quality/reliability/durability, operating costs and drivability. In addition, Blue Bird is the market leader in alternative fuel applications with its propane-powered and compressed natural gas-powered school buses.

      "text": "25 April 2016 Monday 03:20 Long Beach program prepares young autistic adults for jobs and self-sufficiency Called the College Internship Program, the nationwide effort was launched in 1984 to offer job training, social skills counseling and other services to help young adults with disabilities — including those on the autism spectrum — become as self-sufficient... Share on Facebook Tweet \nAlexander Ryan considers himself ambitious, and he's proud that he recently achieved a long-standing goal: landing a part-time job at T.J. Maxx and getting there on public transportation. \nThe 21-year-old from Encino credits his accomplishments, in part, to a program he became involved with soon after he was diagnosed, at age 17, with what was then known as Asperger's syndrome. \nCalled the College Internship Program, the nationwide effort was launched in 1984 to offer job training, social skills counseling and other services to help young adults with disabilities — including those on the autism spectrum — become as self-sufficient as possible. \nThe autism spectrum is a continuum of neurological disorders, including what used to be called Asperger's, that vary in severity but generally make it harder for people to communicate. About 1 in 68 children has been diagnosed as being on the spectrum, according to an estimate by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and more than 83,000 Californians have some degree of autism. \nThe Long Beach program has taken on the specific challenge of helping young adults on the autism spectrum to prepare for the tough circumstances many face when they're no longer entitled to federally guaranteed services such as public school, behavioral therapy, speech therapy or special teacher's aides. See the most-read stories this hour >>Read the story \nAs soon as students with disabilities turn 22 or graduate high school, the federal education money for such services dries up. Although there is money for young adults with developmental disabilities, not everyone who needs it gets it, and people often have to wait. More than a quarter of adults on the autism spectrum don't receive any services, according to a national study Drexel University released in 2015. \nIn California, tax money trickles through regional centers — local hubs that help people with disabilities throughout their lives and sometimes fund programs such as the internship program that helped Ryan. \nLong before Ryan learned that he was on the autism spectrum, he knew he was different. He attended a school in Sherman Oaks for students with disabilities. He always felt nervous, had trouble asking questions, and felt anxious saying \"no.\" \nThe diagnosis, he said, changed his perspective. \"It's actually more a gift instead of a curse,\" said Ryan, who has big blue eyes framed by glasses. \"You get to see the world in a very different way.\" \nMost of the 17 students in the Long Beach program that Ryan enrolled in live together in an apartment complex just off Pacific Coast Highway, where they learn to cook, manage their money, navigate the workplace and socialize. The ultimate goal is self-sufficiency. The program reports that 75% of its alumni are employed full or part time. \nAt T.J. Maxx, Ryan worked his way up from an internship and is now a sales associate, with duties such as stocking merchandise, unboxing clothing and helping customers. He aspires to be a storage representative for the company. One day, he might want to start a family, he says, but first, he has to figure out how strict a dad he should be. He also wants to learn how to drive. \nHelping young adults with autism wrestle with questions of autonomy is a big part of what the Long Beach program does, Ryan and others said. \nOn a recent morning, a student sat with a teacher and read aloud a job description for a position at PetSmart. \n\"I'd be out on the floor most of the time,\" the student said. \n\"Do you feel comfortable doing that?\" his teacher asked. \n\"Yes,\" he said. \"I just need to learn about all the products.\" \nSome lessons are less tangible. \nStudent Claire Bachman, 20, said she'd had a hard time at Agoura High School. She didn't feel close to people and didn't know how to talk in groups. \n\"I felt left out,\" she said, knitting her eyebrows between sentences as she held a squishy orange stress ball to soothe her nerves. \nThe Long Beach program, she said, taught her not only how to do laundry and get through classes at Long Beach City College but also how to relate to people. \n\"I try to forget about high school,\" she said. \"I'm a different person now.\" \nShe knows about the stigmas associated with autism, and she can articulate precisely how she differs from many people her age: She twitches, her speech isn't perfect, she likes putting pressure on her knees, she said. \nBut she is learning how to work around her difficulties. \"I really want to be a strong, independent woman,\" she said. \njoy.resmovits@latimes.com",

It’s a profession,” Ziegler said. “If people see it as a job, they’re never going to survive.” \nHelping teachers not just survive, but thrive, has been her mission as an elementary school principal for more than 20 years. Ziegler will retire at the end of the school year and will be replaced by the school's assistant principal, Jeremy Carlson. \nShe was a teacher at Meadowlark Elementary when her principal encouraged her to go into administration. \n“I saw what some of my principals had done,” she said. “I wanted the opportunity to do that with teachers.” \nShe worked to build a culture of professional development, first at Poly Drive, then at Central Heights and Washington, and finally at Orchard. But she also reached out to parents. \n“Karen came in and said, you are part of the school; we want parents to know we want volunteers here,” said Jill Ackerman, whose daughter attended Central Heights while Ziegler was principal there. Ackerman, whose family was new to Billings at the time, started volunteering in the school office. She hasn’t stopped, serving as a sidekick for Ziegler at each school. \n“Karen sits down and talks to (parents) and just makes them feel comfortable,” she said. \nThat’s an important quality at a school like Orchard. \n“In a lot of the Title schools, a lot of the parents didn’t have a good experience in school,” Ziegler said, referring to the Title 1 designation that earmarks federal money for schools with a high proportion of students from low-income families. \n“If parents know, even if you’re just listening to their side, that builds trust,” Ziegler said. “You kind of learn to walk in their shoes too and look at it from their point of view.” \nZiegler arrived at the school two years ago amid tumultuous times. A group of parents, including Orchard’s PTA president, demanded the ouster of the school’s current principal, Julia Mattson. A group of teachers also requested transfers from Orchard. Other parents stood by Mattson. \n“We were getting lots of concerns about Orchard School, particularly from parents and staff,” said Kathy Olson, an executive director of school leadership for SD2. \nMattson ended up leaving School District 2 mid-year. Olson said that Ziegler volunteered to step in for the next school year. \n“She’s a great person for challenges,” Olson said. \n“Karen can be firm with the children when she needs to be, but they also know they can talk to her about anything,” Ackerman said. \nThat not to say Ziegler walked in and instituted an immediate overhaul. \n“Every school I’ve been in, they all have their own personalities,” she said. “You look at the community you’re in, you look at some needs, you build on their strengths, then you starting building (new) things in … You kind of seek out the people who are always hungry for more knowledge. As soon as you get some of those people on board, it becomes contagious.” \nShe’s overseen the implementation of SD2’s first school clinic, a model the district hopes to expand, and emphasized a responsive classroom, which focuses on positive feedback while still holding kids accountable. \nTeachers help set a classroom’s tone by modeling behaviors — “down to how you push in your chair” — and build a classroom culture from the ground up. \nOrchard also expanded extra-curriculur activities like after-school clubs. \n“The younger we start them, the better,” Ziegler said. “Don’t wait for middle and high school.” \nIn retirement, Ziegler will help look after her grandchildren and expects to stay involved in education in some way, she said. \n“I’m just going to see what doors open.” Tags",

      "text": "Strong job outlook for college graduates Victoria Sanchez, KUSA 8:17 PM. MDT April 25, 2016 A CareerBuilder survey found that the job outlook is strong for soon-to-be college graduates. (Photo: KUSA) CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST \nGood news for college students about to graduate: businesses plan to offer more jobs with bigger salaries to applicants with a four-year degree. The national survey conducted by Harris Poll on behalf of CareerBuilder surveyed 2,186 hiring managers and human resource professionals. It shows the hiring outlook is the highest it's been in nearly a decade. Sixty-seven percent of employers said they plan to hire recent college graduates this year, up from 65 percent. Thirty-seven percent plan to offer higher pay. Getting into the job market right after college is tough but the improving economy means more opportunity for new graduates. \n\"It makes me feel like when I graduate I'm going to be set up for a successful future,\" said Ariana Nikmanesh, a college student at Metro State University Denver. \nBusinesses plan to boost hiring and pay over last year but in Colorado getting the job can be just as difficult as in years past.\"It's still competitive. Even though there are more opportunities it's still competitive because we have a lot of graduates in the state of Colorado and we have a lot of experienced folks who want to live in the state of Colorado that they often compete with for those jobs,\" said Bridgette Coble, director of career services at MSU Denver. \nCoble said although competitive, the job market is on an upswing. This year, MSU Denver had five job fairs with waiting lists for the employers looking to recruit students. \n\"I think it still depends on what field it is,\" said returning student Jason Hodge. \"You've got to get a degree that really means something.\" \nThe businesses in the poll listed their top three majors for new employees. Leading the list are business, computer and information sciences, and engineering degrees. Coble reminds students just because you're in the top three majors that employers want, doesn't automatically mean success. \n\"It's more than just having the college degree. Students to need to have experience along the way to help them compete for those jobs,\" she said. \nIn order to be competitive, graduates need internships, volunteer work and part-time jobs that show employers you'll be a well-rounded employee ready for the real world. \n\"It makes me more excited to finish up my years in college. It helps me remember that what I'm doing in college is definitely going to impact my future,\" said college freshman Brandon Murphy. Most In-Demand College Majors According To Polled Employers: Business – 35 percent Computer and Information Sciences – 23 percent Engineering – 18 percent Math and Statistics – 15 percent Health Professions and Related Clinical Sciences – 14 percent Communications Technologies – 11 percent Communication and Journalism – 8 percent Liberal Arts and Sciences, General Studies and Humanities – 7 percent Science Technologies – 7 percent Biological and Biomedical Sciences – 6 percent Architecture and Planning – 6 percent Education – 5 percent Information technology (27 percent) and customer service jobs (26 percent) top the list of position types for which employers hiring recent college grads are recruiting. Opportunities also abound in finance/accounting (19 percent), business development (19 percent) and sales (17 percent). \nCopyright 2016 KUSA",

      "text": "Director: Jobs there; but few qualified FIX: Budget cuts, lack of transporatation among barriers to connecting workers with employment By DENISE A. RAYMO Press-Republican 3 hrs ago \nMALONE — Jobs are available in Franklin County, but other issues exist beyond employment skills that people lack. \nSylvie Nelson of the North Country Workforce Development Board recently told legislators it’s especially difficult to connect with potential workers ages 16 to 24 and get them the training and job-skill services they need to be more employable. \nBut there is more to it. \n“It’s nice that you want everybody to have jobs, but when you don’t take care of the problems at the source — when you have people who have no transportation, no day-care service or they’re in abusive relationships or have substance-abuse problems — you can’t expect them to be great employees because they have other issues that are bigger,” she said. \n“But by working together to solve these problems, then we can put them in (the available) jobs, and they would be in a better mental state to be more employable. That whole progression is lacking.” \n\nBUDGET SHIFT \nEarlier in her presentation, Nelson said her board represents Clinton, Franklin, Essex and Hamilton counties and that regional strategic planning for employment had not been done for years. \nMembers recently developed a plan that re-energized the board and gave it a fresh direction and progressive goals to pursue on behalf of the underemployed and unemployed. \nShe said 75 percent of the agency’s budget used to go to reach in-school students and 25 percent for those out of school. \nBut that division of effort has recently been reversed so 75 percent of the funding goes to those out of school who are either not trying to break into the workforce or are having a hard time doing so because they lack certain skills or training. \nThe agency offers literacy services for people who need to sharpen or expand their writing and communication skills, job-search or unemployment help, assistance for those with disabilities or special needs and services targeting youths. \nOneWorkSource sites offer a variety of job-assistance services for business owners and potential employees. \n\nTRANSPORTATION LACKING \nJob seekers submit a resume through the State Department of Labor, which is circulated throughout the region and seen by potential employers with job needs. \nAt the same time, the office makes sure applicants are notified of new job postings that meet their qualifications. \n“It’s like an employment service, but it’s done by the state,” Nelson said. \nEliminating social barriers and having too few people qualified for some jobs are where efforts must be concentrated, she said. \nMany potential employees have no vehicle or other means to get to work, but some who live in Franklin County are relying on that county’s Public Transportation Service to get to jobs in Clinton County. \n“It’s filling a need in the Plattsburgh area, so there is a lot of cooperation,” she said. \n\nHUGE GAP \nBut even as the Development Board is trying to help the local economy by filling vacant jobs, Nelson said, the state slashed her budget by 15 percent. \n“We’re going to have to serve less people,” she said, “and we still have a huge gap. We have more jobs than people to fill them.” \nLegislators Chairman Billy Jones (D-Chateaugay) said the tough part is matching the positions and people. \n“There are jobs out there,\" he said. \"We just have to find the right fit and get people into those jobs.\"",

      "text": "New graduates celebrating at University of Venda Graduation Ceremony in South Africa. (file photo) opinion By Anitha Kirezi Unemployment among graduates is increasing each year as universities churn out more fresh batch of job-seekers that far outstrip the jobs in the market. The situation is made worse by the fact that many of the graduates lack skills required by the market. Over 10,000 graduates enter the job market annually, meaning that government and the private sector need to be creating about the same number of jobs, which is not possible. It is for this and other reasons that self-employment becomes the most ideal and sustainable tool that could help reduce unemployment among educated youth. Experts say it is essential that students in higher institutions of learning become innovative and start small income-generating ventures while still in school, which they can build on after graduation. Whether one is passionate about entrepreneurship or not, it is wise not to wait for the day one completes their studies to start job-hunting or thinking about setting up a business. If you have a business idea, share it with like-minded colleagues to refine it before you implement it, according to Victor Nyindi, a senior consultant at Hooza Media Convergence. Nyindi also says the challenge of balancing studies and business should not be an obstacle for one to startup their own enterprise. He notes that one should not wait until they complete university as that might be too late since you are not a monopoly to innovation and thinking. Students should get involved in entrepreneurship activities because you never know that one might even meet their future business partner. Such activities also help develop student's entrepreneurship, as well as communication, and presentation skills. Business ideas Getting a business idea should not be a problem since one can use the skills they already have and venture into that area. For instance, technology students can open repair units for computers or phones, and other electronics from the hostel rooms. A student studying fine art can venture into an art and crafts business or offer advisory services in these areas; they can also start an art studio, something that does not require a lot of money to start. One can start a small stationery shop offering services like typesetting, photocopier, papers and other small items. You can also sell airtime and help people to send or receive money on any of the three mobile telecom networks. Many students own laptops, and with affordable Internet almost everywhere, one can start a bureau to help businesses file the tax returns or those who want to access government services or register new enterprises. So, the problem of lack of money should not be that much of an excuse for one to venture into business while at university as most of these and many others can be opened with as little as Rwf10,000. What is important is a good idea, execution as well as having the right attitude, commitment to work hard and grow the business. More from experts Nyindi says there will also be other facilities to help you implement the venture as a student, especially when you seek advice from business mentors, or use the library to research on your business idea. You can also choose to join business societies where you can be able to find other like-minded entrepreneurs with whom you can share ideas he adds. Students need to understand that, whatever business one initiates, they will have to consider their community's needs and involvement before they invest. \"While at it, control the cash and reinvest in the business so that by the end of the four-year course, the business has grown and is sustainable. This will give you a launch pad to even expand more since you will be doing it full time,\" Nyindi says. Eddie Mugarura, a business and investment consultant, says starting an own business as a student is more flexible, more rewarding compared to working for others on a part-time job. \"Instead of looking for jobs, university students are better off using part of their pocket money to start income-generating projects where they can devote most of the free time to ensure the enterprises are profitable,\" he says. Mugarura says university timetables are usually flexible, giving students enough time to attend to their businesses. \"Lectures take about six hours per week or at most less in some cases providing weekends plus at least 10hrs per week. He advises students to use available resources in terms of skills, physical labour and contacts, and avoid hiring workers at the initial stages of the enterprise. \"Turning small amounts into a big business is what makes a person a good entrepreneur. So, you do not need millions to start and instead of looking for jobs you can concentrate on your small project; when it succeeds, this will reduce the financial burden from your family and relatives,\" he says.

      "text": "Thirty colleges have been selected as planning grant awardees for UNCF’s new Career Pathways Initiative (CPI) , a highly-competitive grant process open to four-year historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs) and predominantly black institutions (PBIs) to help students gain the knowledge, preparation, insight and skills needed for meaningful employment upon graduation. Lilly Endowment Inc. committed $50 million in October 2015 to launch the UNCF® Career Pathways Initiative, to improve the job placement outcomes of graduates from HBCUs and PBIs. Institutions will employ various strategies to achieve this goal, including aligning curricula with local and national workforce needs, developing intentional career pathway options for students across their collegiate experience, and strengthening their career service operations. The collective planning grant distribution announced today totals $2.55 million, which has the potential to assist more than 66,000 students across the 30 colleges and universities.\n\"The UNCF® Career Pathways Initiative is not only important to HBCUs and PBIs, it is important for the entire American higher education system and the American global economy,” said Dr. Michael L. Lomax, UNCF president and CEO. “CPI will serve as a model of best practices for all colleges and universities to follow, in order to ensure that we are meeting the needs of our students and the demands of the ever-changing marketplace for talent. We’re excited that HBCUs and PBIs will be at the forefront of this new and impactful venture. We applaud all of the institutions that put their best foot forward in the interest of their students’ future careers, and we commend the 30 institutions that were selected.\"\nThe rigorous and competitive grant process opened in December 2015 to 87 eligible public and private institutions, of which 81 were HBCUs and six were PBIs. The eligible institutions must have met select criteria, including being an accredited four-year degree-granting institution that awards most of its degrees at the bachelor's level. Of the 87 eligible institutions, 70 applied for the planning grant and 30 were selected as grantees.\nOf the 30 recipients, 29 are HBCUs and one is a PBI. Twenty-three of the selected grantees are among the 37 private UNCF-supported institutions. The six-month planning grants are one-time awards that help the institutions research and envision programs that will strengthen their efforts to prepare students for sustaining and meaningful careers. Award amounts vary based on the institution's student enrollment. Tier I institutions enroll more than 2,500 students; Tier II institutions enroll between 1,250 and 2,499 students; and Tier III institutions enroll a maximum of 1,249 students.

Programs will be expected to engage college faculty in the development of curricula that is aligned with workforce needs to better prepare students to compete in careers of their choice. The initiative also will help institutions build partnerships with local and national employers and improve student career services.\nPlanning grantees were selected based on how well their proposals reflected understanding of the challenges facing students as they prepare for post-graduate employment. In addition, successful proposals included evidence that the institutions had connected with experts who can help them find innovative solutions. The 30 institutions will be eligible to compete for a smaller number of implementation grants, of $1 million to $1.5 million, to be announced this fall.\nSince the Great Recession ended in 2009, the problem of underemployment has become a crisis for young adults. By early 2015, the underemployment rate for recent college graduates had reached 44 percent, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. The statistics are even more alarming for African American graduates. As recently as 2013, the unemployment rate for African American college graduates between ages 22 and 27 was 12.4 percent, more than twice the rate of their white counterparts. And in 2014, the share of recent African American college graduates who were underemployed soared to 56 percent. Furthermore, a recent Georgetown University workforce study found that African Americans are underrepresented in the number of college majors associated with the fastest-growing, highest-paying occupations, with only seven percent entering the STEM fields of science, technology, engineering and mathematics.\nUNCF® CPI was created to address these issues . This program falls under UNCF’s Institute for Capacity Building (ICB), which works collaboratively with UNCF-member institutions to enhance their infrastructure, sustainability and success in a number of operational areas. Dr. Brian K. Bridges, UNCF vice president for research and member engagement, leads ICB efforts in addition to UNCF’s Frederick D. Patterson Research Institute ( FDPRI ).\n“The mission of CPI truly validates our capacity-building work, as we aim to equip the next generation of 21st-century employees directly from HBCUs and PBIs,” Bridges said. “CPI will provide transformational support to institutions that do more with less, allowing them to further extend their ability to positively impact students’ lives for years after graduation.”\nData from FDPRI show that although HBCUs comprise only three percent of all four-year colleges and universities in the United States, these institutions award nearly 20 percent of the bachelor’s degrees earned by African American students nationally. Their impact with students in STEM fields is also significant, as 25 percent of bachelor degrees in STEM fields earned by African American students in the country are awarded by HBCUs.\nCPI is led by director Edward Smith-Lewis, and its programmatic success will be measured through accountability and evaluation metrics that will be assessed periodically throughout the program and at its conclusion to determine impact, effectiveness and replicability. The inaugural annual convening of CPI grantees, to be held in June 2016 in Atlanta, will provide opportunities for participating institutions to share best practices, learn from each other and from leading experts in career preparation, and foster collaborations to maximize collective impact.\nLilly Endowment has been a supporter each year since UNCF’s inception in 1944 and its 2015 commitment of $50 million ties for the second-largest contribution that UNCF has received in its 72-year history.\n###\nUNCF® CAREER PATHWAYS INITIATIVE FACT SHEET\nAbout Lilly Endowment Inc.\nLilly Endowment Inc. is a private philanthropic foundation created in 1937 by three members of the Lilly family — J.K.

      "text": "Vote Campaign \nThe upcoming Pennsylvania primary marks the first voting opportunity for many millennial voters. \nThe November primary will be the first national-scale election in which Generation Y voters make up the same amount, if not more, of the eligible electorate than the baby-boomers. This makes millennial voters the largest generation in U.S. history. \nAccording to a 2015 census, those falling into the millennial generation, between the ages of 18 and 30, account for 83.1 million versus 76.4 million in the baby boomers generation. And while these are general numbers that don't specify participating voters, experts are not counting these young votes as insignificant. \nFormer House Speaker Newt Gingrich urged a crowd of young voters in Houston in March, \"This is really important because this is the first election that millennials have the potential to be the largest voting bloc, more than seniors.\" \nThough the millennial voters are massive in numbers, their actual participation is unpromising. Some national politicians have donned these voters as the \"all throat, no vote\" generation. \nRecent changes to voter registration and poll-day protocols have made it less appealing, even inconvenient, for young voters to mark their ballots. Stricter voter identification requirements and polling hours that fail to align with college classes have made many millennials turn away from the process. What's more, those registering as independents or with some unspecified parties cannot vote in Pennsylvania's closed primary. \nAccording to information provided by Ed Allison, director of Voter Registration in Lawrence County, these non-affiliated millennials are a major concern. As of April 6, 1,202 combined voters born between 1986 and 1998 have registered in the county as Independent, No Affiliation, No Party, or Other. \nThat is compared to 3,179 registered Democrats and 2,951 registered Republicans on the same generation. Of Lawrence County voters in the same pool who voted in the last presidential election and are still registered with the same parties, there were 698 Democrats and 636 Republicans and 179 not affiliated with any particular party. Comparing these numbers to now, this would mean that there are 5,876 total assumed “new” millennial voters registered to vote this time around. \nAccording to Anne Walther, a sophomore at Westminster College and head of the school's Young Republican efforts, uninformed, unaffiliated voters are detrimental to themselves. \n\"We want to inform people about what's going on,\" she said. \"A lot of students don't know the difference between a Republican and a Democrat. We're trying to help inform people.\" \nWalther hopes that by holding issue-specific discussion groups and voter-registration events, her campus group can make a difference in voting numbers on election day. \n\"The most dangerous thing besides a non-voter is a misinformed voter,\" she said. \n\"Foreign policy really scares me. The economy ... we have a system where people are afraid of succeeding. The government needs to be a trampoline, not a safety net,\" Walther said. Of the issues most concerning to her, Walther said feeling secure after graduation is on the top of her list. \n\"We need a president who's going to create jobs and incentive for people to want to succeed. People can't rely on the government to bounce back,\" she said. \nWalther also expressed that while she doesn't necessarily agree with all of Donald Trump's campaign rhetoric, she believes he is the strongest candidate to oppose either Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders. \n\"Cruz just doesn't seem strong,\" she said. \"We need a republican and can't afford to divide the party. If we go to a contested convention, people will be very upset.\" \nElizabeth Stelle, a former executive for the former Lawrence County Young Republicans, which is no longer active in a formal capacity, agrees that keeping the GOP united is critical. \n\"People feel very strongly,\" she said, \"and I think that whatever happen, people realize how important growing the (Republican) party is. We need to unite for a cause and make change.\" \nStelle echoed Walther's sentiments of financial opportunity, saying she believes her generation is most concerned with economic growth. \n\"I'd say my generation is most concerned with not being able to get ahead. People my age still living with their parents...there's a lack of growth and it goes beyond party lines.\" \nAfter only becoming involved in politics after moving to Lawrence County five years ago, Stelle said she has seen her peers in their 20's and 30's \"disgusted\" with the lack of bipartisan effort in Washington. Though she doesn't side with any particular candidate entirely, she believes that pushing local issues is the first step in seeing changes happen on the national level. \n\"It's important to take action in what's going on, inform yourself, because what happens in Lawrence County effects you more in your every day life,\" Stelle said. \n(Email: )",

      "text": "BY MATT TROUTMAN mtroutman@record-eagle.com 3 hrs ago \nTRAVERSE CITY — A principal slated for the top job at Courtade Elementary School will instead leave K-12 education altogether. \nTraverse City Central High School Principal Rick Vandermolen said Tuesday he has accepted a full-time teaching position at Grand Valley State University. He said he'll resign from a 14-year career with Traverse City Area Public Schools effective June 30. \n\"There’s so many memories,\" he said. \"It’s been a wonderful part of my career.\" \nTCAPS officials in March announced that Vandermolen would transfer to Courtade Elementary School to serve as its principal. \nSuperintendent Paul Soma acknowledged being a little surprised when he learned that Vandermolen accepted the GVSU position, but said it made sense given that Vandermolen in the last couple years spoke about becoming a professor. \n\"What we have to do now is look at the void that’s created at Courtade,\" Soma said. \nWestwoods Elementary School Principal Jessie Houghton will take over Vandermolen's position at Central High School. \nVandermolen recently came under fire following the abrupt resignation of Central varsity girls basketball coach Heather Simpson. Complaints about a lack of administrative support for Simpson prompted TCAPS officials to launch an investigation. \nThat probe ended with Associate Superintendent Sander Scott filing a strongly-worded reprimand in Vandermolen's personnel file, which Vandermolen refuted and refused to sign. Vandermolen said the situation had nothing to do with his application for the GVSU job. \n\"No, it didn’t have any bearing on this position that I’ve applied for and accepted,\" he said. He applied for the job in late February or early March, he said. \nVandermolen said he'll teach classes for master's and education specialist degrees. He said he believes his experiences will help support the principals and aspiring principals he'll end up teaching. \nIt also creates the chance, however slight, that Soma could be one of his students. Soma is working toward his master's degree at GVSU and said he only has two classes left. He said Vandermolen — who will continue to live in the Traverse City area — will maintain personal and professional ties to TCAPS. \n\"If I had five or six classes to go, it wouldn’t surprise me if he was teaching one,\" Soma said.

The Technical Career High School in Idaho Falls is just one of the schools in the area that are helping contribute to Idaho's rising employment levels.\"There are many jobs in these fields in Idaho, and we're trying to help. Whenever we're looking at offering a new program, new courses at our school, we always meet with the Department of Labor and make sure there are jobs tied to those,\" said Technical Careers High School Principal Craig Miller.The high school has a mutually beneficial relationship with the Idaho Department of Labor, and thanks to the school's programs, students are strongly prepared for the job market.\"If you are a high school student, it is a great time to get a job. Because the labor market is so tight, employers are willing to take on somebody that necessarily doesn't have a track record with showing professionalism or things like that,\" said Department of Labor Regional Economist Chris St. Jeor.Jobs are so plentiful, that employers are ready to recruit right out of high school, or even before the student completes his college program.And these career schools are having hard times keeping their students in these programs for their full terms. Nevertheless, they are very pleased at how fast their students are getting jobs.Idaho employers are looking for students with potential they can bring into their workforce as soon as possible.

      "text": "On-The-Job Training Program Helps Young Man with Asperger’s Syndrome Find Dream Job PRWeb \nIn honor of Autism Awareness Month, Vocational Rehabilitation shares the story of a young man's journey to find a job he loves Spring Hill, FL (PRWEB) April 27, 2016 \nAs a teacher at Little Rascals Daycare, Alex Dissell’s days are filled with the screams, laughter, and occasional tantrums of his three-year-old students — and he wouldn’t have it any other way. “I may go home tired, but I go home feeling like I’ve accomplished something,” Alex says. “When a student gives me a hug at the end of the day, it’s just the best feeling. It makes me never want to leave this job. That’s how I know that I’ve found my career.” \nAlex wasn’t always so sure of his career plans. He has Asperger’s syndrome, a disability on the autism spectrum that makes it hard for him to interact with others and stay focused on tasks. Still, he was determined to work— so he went to Vocational Rehabilitation (VR), an agency that helps people with disabilities get or keep jobs. \nAlex met with his VR Counselor, Kristina Risola, to create his path to employment. Because he loved working with children and wanted to give back to his community, Alex decided to become certified as a child care worker. \nAfter completing his certification, Alex gained work experience at Care-a-Lot Daycare though VR’s On-The-Job Training (OJT) program. The OJT program allows employers to mentor people with disabilities, helping them to get used to working in a professional environment while developing the skills they need to succeed on the job. \nAlex made the most of his OJT opportunity, even waking up hours before his shift began to walk to the daycare when he faced transportation issues. The dedication paid off. At the end of his training, he found a full time job as a teaching assistant at Little Rascals Daycare, and he was promoted to a lead teacher just six months later. \nKristina is proud to see Alex’s progress. “When I first met Alex, he had a hard time speaking and making eye contact with me,” Kristina recalls. “During his time at VR, he made a specific effort to improve his social skills, which wasn’t easy for him because of his disability. Since then, he has really grown into himself and become so confident and charismatic — he even has a certain swagger. Alex is just awesome; there is no one quite like him.” \nIn the future, Alex dreams of working his way up to a director position or even of opening his own daycare; but for now, he is grateful that he was given the chance to prove himself on the job. “People with disabilities can work; you just have to give them a chance and get to know them,” he says. “If you are direct with them and challenge them, you never know what they can do.” \nAbout Vocational Rehabilitation Florida’s Vocational Rehabilitation (VR) is a federal-state program committed to helping people with disabilities become part of America’s workforce. The employer-focused website, https://abilitieswork.employflorida.com/ , allows businesses to search at no charge for employees who are ready to go to work, as well as to post available jobs. VR has 90 offices across Florida, and last year helped 5,760 Floridians with significant disabilities find or keep a job.

      "text": "Featured Company Featured Company Pinnaca's Successful Distance Learning Program Has Helped Thousands of Veterans and Dislocated Workers Find High-Skilled Manufacturing Jobs in Minn. and Wis. Business Wire Wednesday, April 27th 2016 Increase in success due to one-of-a-kind Acano video technology that connects workers, companies and educators anytime, anywhere, on any device Search VSM: Advanced \nPinnaca (formerly Video Guidance), a leading strategic visual communications and collaboration service provider, is playing a lead role in training thousands of Veterans and dislocated manufacturing workers in Minnesota and Western Wisconsin. In mid 2014, a unique consortium was launched -- Advanced Manufacturing Education (AME) -- to upgrade skills of the manufacturing workforce. By the end of 2015, just over a year later, the number of individuals trained through AME has catapulted from 13 to 1,009 workers, studying 58 courses. Some workers have taken multiple courses, doubling the number of class seats to 2,040. In addition, the program’s partners have expanded from three to 92 employers/businesses, workforce/labor organizations and prisons through the Department of Corrections. \nThe successful initiative has been made even more impactful thanks to a new, one-of-a-kind, multimedia cloud-based service that allows workers to connect to the classroom using a phone, tablet, computer or video system. Pinnaca’s new Video Conferencing as a Service platform is based on Acano technology that unites previously incompatible audio, video and web technologies. Now students can connect anytime, anywhere on any device. \n“Pinnaca has cracked the nut,” said Dr. Tom Stober, lead instructor for the AME courses and president of True North – Compass, which provides customized training solutions focused on process and organizational improvement. “The Acano technology is less expensive and more deliverable. It provides unprecedented solutions for our distance learning because we can virtually connect everyone on any communications device. It’s not limited to bandwidth and it’s not point to point; it’s point to many.” \nAME is a regional consortium of employers, workforce and government agencies, community organizations, and institutions of higher education that include Central Lakes College, Pine Technical and Community College, St. Cloud Technical and Community College, and Bemidji State University’s 360 Manufacturing Center of Excellence. \nSince its inception, the AME program has focused on connecting colleges to companies, Veterans and TAA-impacted workers. Today the initiative has expanded to provide distance learning training to prisoners, to unions assisting their member workforces and to many other businesses and organizations. \n“Video eliminates distance and time barriers and enhances the learning experience,” said Heidi Braun, program director for customized training at Pine Technical and Community College. “And now, with Pinnaca’s new Acano technology, learning has no limits.” \nThe consortium’s program, the Regional Advanced Manufacturing Re-Training (RAMR), has created high-wage, high-skilled employment outcomes for workers in Minnesota and Wisconsin. The video conferencing system is funded through a $13.1 million Federal Department of Labor TAACCCT (Trade Adjustment Assistance Community College and Career Training) grant awarded to the consortium. \n“Video conferencing has revolutionized the way people connect and as a result, educational institutions and organizations everywhere are making visual communications a strategic priority,” said Mike Nelson of Pinnaca. “Our new technology has helped to create unlimited opportunities for workers to learn the new skills necessary to find higher-wage jobs. It is so exciting to see these amazing results.” \nCollege Manufacturing Faculty, in cooperation with Adult Basic Education and College Developmental Education personnel, offers introductory, core manufacturing courses to expand the educated labor pool. Enhanced online courses emphasize advanced manufacturing areas of machining, metals, plastics and composites, automation technology and rapid prototyping. \nIn the AME alliance, participating higher education institutions solicit partners to provide real-time training that meets partner needs. Courses are held via on-line interactive classrooms, which allow participants to connect from work or home, saving both time and money. \nIn each course, participants connect with a subject matter expert and industry peers to discuss and work on real world solutions which benefit everyone.

        "title": "Busy beehives provide up-close learning experience in Leominster \nMA_Worcester_Telegram LEOMINSTER - Dressed in a full protective suit, Monica Cayenne-Robinson stood back a little as beehives behind the Boys and Girls Club of Fitchburg and Leominster were opened for inspection Monday afternoon.\nThe 14-year-old Leominster High School student didn't run away as the hive was opened and honeycombs taken out, but she was a little wary of having stinging insects buzzing around her.\n\"I'm still afraid of them, but I am starting to get to know them better,\" she said.\nMonica was one of six youths from Fitchburg and Leominster participating in the beekeeping program at the Boys and Girls Club. The program was created three years ago by Jon Blodgett, teen center director at the club and Leominster Police Officer Patrick Aubuchon at the suggestion of Donata Martin, director of the club. It is a work in progress.\nLast fall the hives produced a little honey. This year for the first time a hive survived through the winter. All three hives are now swarming with honeybees. With things so far along this spring, Mr. Blodgett said they are hoping to get honey by sometime in the summer, and triple the 25 pounds they got last year.\nThe program, which is held at the club on Litchfield Street gives high school and middle school-age youths from Fitchburg and Leominster a chance to experience something they may not have considered growing up and also to learn about the honeybee, one of nature's most essential and endangered insects.\nAn earlier science project got Laura Janny, 17, interested in the beekeeping program. Working with local farms, she said, she learned how pesticides were affecting crops and the bees that pollinate them.\n\"When I did the science project I realized how important bees were to everything we do because they are a main source of pollination for our crops,\" she said. \"Obviously if we don't have bees we lose that source and we lose our food sources, too.\"\nWhat really sparked Laura's interest was a chance to see a hive close up this summer with a professor who worked with her on her science project. She said she knew the club had a beekeeping program, but she never thought about joining it until she learned more about bees.\n\"Before that I wasn't interested in them,\" she said, \"I thought, 'They're bees. Like, they sting.' When I got to see them up close and saw how neat the hive was, that's really when I got really interested in them.\"\nAfter seeing the hive, she went to Mr. Blodgett and said she wanted to sign up.\nThe students came to the program for a variety of reasons. Brett Houck, 16, a student at Leominster High School, said he joined the beekeeping program because it looked interesting, but also because it was chance to challenge himself.\n\"I used to be afraid of bees,\" he said. \"I faced my fears and now I am not scared anymore.\"\nBrett said he was stung once and is careful around the bees, but is not afraid of them. On Monday, he volunteered to be the one to smoke the bees. It required him to stand next to the hive and pump smoke onto the bees to calm them down. Ignoring them buzzing around him, he kept pumping the puffs of smoke as Mr. Blodgett took the boxes apart to inspect the bee-coated combs.\nThe program offers the students insight into the life cycle of the bees, the roles of the queen drones and worker bees, their ability to make honey and reasons for the honey and the challenges facing bees.\nHoneybee populations have suffered significant losses since 2007, from various causes, including colony collapse syndrome. From 2007 to 2013 almost 6 million beehives were lost. Because of concern over the health of the hives, Mr. Blodgett said, they regularly check the hives to ensure that the queen and the other bees appear healthy.\nMr. Blodgett and the students care for the bees throughout the year, feeding them sugar packets and sugar water in the winter and spring until they make enough honey to sustain the queen and new drones and workers. He said this week the bees were eating less of their sugared water, an indication they were bringing in nectar from plants.\nMr. Blodgett said he and Officer Aubuchon were not trained beekeepers before they started the program. They learned on the job and from local beekeepers. They also attended a beekeepers school last year run by the Worcester County Beekeepers Association. He said they had hoped to attend again this year but there is so much interest now in beekeeping the classes were filled.\nThe program is open to students from Fitchburg and Leominster taking part in the Boys and Girls Club programs, but limited by the number of suits. Some of the equipment for the program, including the suits, was purchased in part with a $1,000 grant from Burt's Bees Co., which offers grants to student science programs.",

      "text": "LEOMINSTER - Dressed in a full protective suit, Monica Cayenne-Robinson stood back a little as beehives behind the Boys and Girls Club of Fitchburg and Leominster were opened for inspection Monday afternoon. The 14-year-old Leominster High School student didn't run away as the hive was opened and honeycombs taken out, but she was a little wary of having stinging insects buzzing around her. \"I'm still afraid of them, but I am starting to get to know them better,\" she said. Monica was one of six youths from Fitchburg and Leominster participating in the beekeeping program at the Boys and Girls Club. The program was created three years ago by Jon Blodgett, teen center director at the club and Leominster Police Officer Patrick Aubuchon at the suggestion of Donata Martin, director of the club. It is a work in progress. Last fall the hives produced a little honey. This year for the first time a hive survived through the winter. All three hives are now swarming with honeybees. With things so far along this spring, Mr. Blodgett said they are hoping to get honey by sometime in the summer, and triple the 25 pounds they got last year. The program, which is held at the club on Litchfield Street gives high school and middle school-age youths from Fitchburg and Leominster a chance to experience something they may not have considered growing up and also to learn about the honeybee, one of nature's most essential and endangered insects. An earlier science project got Laura Janny, 17, interested in the beekeeping program. Working with local farms, she said, she learned how pesticides were affecting crops and the bees that pollinate them. \"When I did the science project I realized how important bees were to everything we do because they are a main source of pollination for our crops,\" she said. \"Obviously if we don't have bees we lose that source and we lose our food sources, too.\" What really sparked Laura's interest was a chance to see a hive close up this summer with a professor who worked with her on her science project. She said she knew the club had a beekeeping program, but she never thought about joining it until she learned more about bees. \"Before that I wasn't interested in them,\" she said, \"I thought, 'They're bees. Like, they sting.' When I got to see them up close and saw how neat the hive was, that's really when I got really interested in them.\" After seeing the hive, she went to Mr. Blodgett and said she wanted to sign up. The students came to the program for a variety of reasons. Brett Houck, 16, a student at Leominster High School, said he joined the beekeeping program because it looked interesting, but also because it was chance to challenge himself. \"I used to be afraid of bees,\" he said. \"I faced my fears and now I am not scared anymore.\" Brett said he was stung once and is careful around the bees, but is not afraid of them. On Monday, he volunteered to be the one to smoke the bees. It required him to stand next to the hive and pump smoke onto the bees to calm them down. Ignoring them buzzing around him, he kept pumping the puffs of smoke as Mr. Blodgett took the boxes apart to inspect the bee-coated combs. The program offers the students insight into the life cycle of the bees, the roles of the queen drones and worker bees, their ability to make honey and reasons for the honey and the challenges facing bees. Honeybee populations have suffered significant losses since 2007, from various causes, including colony collapse syndrome. From 2007 to 2013 almost 6 million beehives were lost. Because of concern over the health of the hives, Mr. Blodgett said, they regularly check the hives to ensure that the queen and the other bees appear healthy. Mr. Blodgett and the students care for the bees throughout the year, feeding them sugar packets and sugar water in the winter and spring until they make enough honey to sustain the queen and new drones and workers.

David Aviles and Alex Hillsman are working part time at American & Efird as part of a new program at the school. The teens applied, went through an interview process and even passed drug tests and background checks to work for the industrial textile company based in Mount Holly. Both teens are now helping technicians at a company plant. They leave Forestview every weekday after their third classes and work from around 2 p.m. to 6 p.m. This program is the first of its kind for the high school and for the company, said Heather Forbes, the school’s career development coordinator. She hopes the school can continue to offer students to work part time at American & Efird. In exchange, the company helps prepare students with technical skills that will get them jobs after graduation, Forbes said. “We’d love to expand the program and open it to more than just two students,” she said. “It depends on the needs of the company.” Aviles and Hillsman have are earning school credit from work to make up for missed classes. They were accepted into the program at Forestview thanks in part to teacher recommendation, Forbes said. Forestview’s career training program focuses on manufacturing and electrical trades. Other schools in the county offer other specialties like automotive, she said. She believes Aviles and Hillsman have been a good example of what Gaston schools can offer local employers. “They have done an excellent job,” she said. “They meshed well with A&E. We hear nothing but respect from all of their supervisors.\" By Wade Tyler Millward wmillward@gastongazette.com Gaston Gazette By Wade Tyler Millward wmillward@gastongazette.com Posted Apr. 27, 2016 at 5:41 PM",

(AP Photo/Darron Cummings) Trump vows to stop job loss in Indianapolis campaign stop Former IU coach Bob Knight spoke in support of presidential hopeful By Christopher Stephens The Herald Bulletin 3 hrs ago Darron Cummings \nRepublican presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks during a campaign stop Wednesday, April 27, 2016, in Indianapolis. (AP Photo/Darron Cummings) \nINDIANAPOLIS — Presidential candidate Donald Trump's second rally in Indiana was markedly subdued as the candidate focused on preventing companies from leaving the United States and bad trade deals that he said had hurt Hoosier workers. \nWith the help of a Hoosier icon, former Indiana University basketball coach Bobby Knight, Trump got his message across. \nThe Indiana Farmer's Coliseum at the Indiana State Fairgrounds was packed with people holding red, white and blue signs supporting Trump on Wednesday night ahead of Tuesday's primary. \nThe event was calm compared to some Trump rallies, with protesters banned from the Fairgrounds. \nKnight introduced Trump at the rally, saying he can set the country on the right path. \n\"You will be responsible for the shift into what America should be if you vote for Donald Trump,\" Knight said to the crowd of several thousand strong. \nKevin Knight, an IU graduate student not related to Bobby Knight, attended the rally Wednesday and said he already planned to skip class and see Trump speak, but Bobby Knight's appearance \"sweetened the pot.\" \n\"He's an icon of Indiana history,\" Kevin Knight said. \"Having (Bobby) Knight here is an important way to connect with Hoosiers.\" \nJosh Anderson, South Bend, was wearing an IU sweatshirt at the rally and said Knight and Trump fit together because of their bombastic personalities. \n\"Just like Coach Knight, (Trump) speaks his mind, and I like them both for that,\" Anderson said. \nAfter Trump took the stage at the rally, he focused mainly on trade deals such as NAFTA and the Trans-Atlantic Partnership, which he said make it easier for American manufacturers to move overseas. He specifically called out Carrier, an HVAC manufacturing company that earlier this year announced that the business would move to Mexico, putting nearly 1,400 Hoosier workers out of jobs. \nSeveral former Carrier workers in the crowd called out to Trump, who said his plan to stop manufacturers from moving overseas was to charge a 35 percent tax on every product a company like Carrier ships into the United States. \n\"Then they will call and say, 'President, Carrier has decided to stay in Indiana,\" Trump said to thunderous applause and cheers of \"U-S-A!\" \nTrump's message to support American manufacturing jobs resonated with Mark Hale, who is still has not decided who to vote for Tuesday. Trump will be opposed by Ohio Gov. John Kasich and U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas. \nHale said he wanted to come out to see for himself what Trump was like. But Hale was already sold on Trump's message to \"make America great again,\" by keeping manufacturers from leaving. \nOne of Trump's sons, Donald Trump Jr., briefly took the stage alongside his father, saying America needs someone who has \"spent years signing the front of checks.\" \n\"Bring in someone who understands what job creation is,\" Trump Jr. urged. \"If you think the system is working, then fine. But I don't think a lot of people do. It's time for a change, and no one else is going to work harder for you.\" Sign Up / Sign In With your existing account from... {* loginWidget *}",

Related Content \nThey break bread--or rather, pizza crust--and reflect on their lives and their religion, but Hudson says these times may come to an end. \nHe was notified in February that he would be let go at the end of the year before receiving his tenure. \n\"The only thing I can think of is that I am being harassed about my faith in Jesus Christ,\" Hudson says his only conflict with the school was when he was written up for questioning the principal when asked to remove various Christian inspired quotes from his classroom. \n\"Why do I have to bring my stuff down when there are other people with gay and lesbian paraphernalia, zombie paraphernalia, communism paraphernalia, that to me were not academically based and even if they were expressions of what this district supposedly preaches about tolerance and diversity.\" \nAlong with religious decor, Hudson says he plays Christian music in the classroom. \n\"The district has made it clear that they want us to stick to a curriculum that they gave me, and in that curriculum there is a section that says we have to teach on religious beliefs, so i definitely believe that is a part of the curriculum.\" \nWhen we reached out to Palm Springs Unified School District to comment on why Hudson was being let go, they were unable to comment due to confidentiality laws. \nThe district did send us a potion of the education code stating, \"Instruction about religion shall not promote or denigrate the beliefs or customs of any particular religion or sect, nor should a preference be shown for one religious viewpoint over another.\" \nHudson tells us he has also been out of school since December after being diagnosed with a heart condition that had developed during his time working in the district. \nHe currently has a heart monitor. He thinks it may also have something to do with why he has been let go. \nHudson told us he is still on medical leave and if he is not cleared by his doctor to return to the classroom by next week, then he will lose his salary and his benefits. \nHe is unsure if he will take legal action but says he has forgiven the district. \nCopyright 2016 Gulf California Broadcasting.

      "text": "St. Clairsville Oil & Gas Expo Highlights Job Opportunities April 28, 2016 Save | \nRepresentatives from the education and job training sector were on hand during Wednesday's Oil and Gas Expo in St. Clairsville to talk to potential students and families about preparing for the employment opportunities of the future. \nEducational programs at both the high school and college levels were on display as representatives from the Ohio Valley Energy Technology Academy, which serves high school students, talked with visitors about their program at Buckeye Local High School. Kevin McCain, an instructor with OVETA, said the program has five students graduating this year and a current enrollment of 53. \nHe described the curriculum as \"blended learning\" and said students can complete their high school curriculum either full-time at school or part-time working from home. OVETA defines blended learning as a combination of classroom time, online education and field experience. Article Photos \nPhoto by Kathryn Clayton / St. Clairsville High School seniors, from left, Madison Pitcher, Kaylie Kindler and Dallas DeLong investigate high-tech drones owned by Orbital Engineering Inc. while volunteering at the Ohio Valley Oil and Gas Association Expo Wednesday. \nMcCain said students are obligated to meet state requirements in general subjects such as English, math and social studies and can participate in extracurricular activities in their home school district while enrolled. He noted they are interested in students from Monroe, Belmont and Harrison counties. \nMcCain said students complete the program with Occupational Safety and Health Administration training and Safeland training, which is similar to OSHA but specific to the oil and gas industry. \nAlso in attendance was the Utica Shale Academy, which also focuses on high school students and provides a customizable digital curriculum. Graduates receive both a high school diploma as well as certificates and have options to earn college credit. \nBelmont College and California University of Pennsylvania were present to talk about higher learning opportunities. Ed Mowrer, energy institute manager for Belmont College, said the school offers both short-term and long-term educational and training opportunities related to the industry. \nShort-term options include CDL licensing as well as OSHA and Safeland training. Mowrer said Belmont College has tailored some of its long-term programs that have been in place for many years for applicability in oil and gas. \nPrograms like industrial electronics and civil engineering have seen curriculum adjustments for relevance to the industry. Mowrer said it is the school's philosophy to offer broad degrees, so that students are prepared to work in a variety of capacities within the industry. The goal is to produce students who are good employees all-around, he said. \nMowrer also noted the college offers a course, Introduction to Oil and Gas, that is both general and part of broader programs. He said students ages 16-65 participate in the course, and some have taken it just to understand what's happening around the region.",

      "text": "Business leaders say early childhood education funding is key to filling STEM jobs in future Comment Posted Apr. 27, 2016 at 2:00 PM Updated at 5:58 PM Posted Apr 27, 2016 at 2:00 PM Updated at 5:58 PM Some Illinois business leaders said Wednesday the state needs to invest more in early childhood programs to ensure students will be prepared for future careers in fields requiring math and science education. Members of ReadyNation Illinois called on lawmakers to support a $75 million increase in early childhood programs that can help prevent children from falling behind early in academic areas that can prepare them to take jobs in fields related to science, technology, engineering and math, or STEM. Rudy Valdez, vice president of an economic development organization in Rockford, said the state is expected to add 100,000 jobs in the science and technology and health fields from 2010 to 2020, but some of those jobs will go unfilled because of a lack of qualified candidates. “Without focused efforts, we won’t be able to fill all of these positions with highly skilled, fully qualified workers,” he said. “We’re falling short. Research shows that high-quality early learning investments in young children can get us back on track.” Tom Fitch, vice president of Harold O’Shea Builders of Springfield, said more people are retiring from those positions than are entering them. “These are good-paying jobs,” he said. “Many of them boast salaries that are more than double the median U.S. salary. We have a continuing shortage of manpower, skilled labor, project managers that require good STEM skills. A better focus on early learning can help us lay a solid foundation for our future workforce.” Budget cuts have resulted in about 20,000 children losing access to state-funded preschool services. The group said Sangamon County lost 694 pre-K slots from 2009 to 2015, or nearly 36 percent. Gov. Bruce Rauner has called for an increase in early childhood programs and wants lawmakers to approve a K-12 education budget that will ensure schools open on time next fall. However, Senate President John Cullerton, D-Chicago, has indicated he first wants the state's school funding formula to be revised to ensure education dollars go to school districts that need them the most. Sean Noble, Illinois director of ReadyNation, said the group has not taken a position on the education funding formula proposal. — Contact Doug Finke: doug.finke @sj-r.com, 788-1527, twitter.com/dougfinkesjr .

      "text": "Darron Cummings | The Associated Press \nRepublican presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks during a campaign stop Wednesday, April 27 in Indianapolis. Trump vows to stop job loss Former IU coach Bob Knight spoke in support of presidential hopeful By Christopher Stephens | The Herald Bulletin 12 hrs ago Darron Cummings | The Associated Press \nRepublican presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks during a campaign stop Wednesday, April 27 in Indianapolis. \nINDIANAPOLIS — Presidential candidate Donald Trump's second rally in Indiana was markedly subdued as the candidate focused on preventing companies from leaving the United States and bad trade deals that he said had hurt Hoosier workers. \nWith the help of a Hoosier icon, former Indiana University basketball coach Bobby Knight, Trump got his message across. \nThe Indiana Farmer's Coliseum at the Indiana State Fairgrounds was packed with people holding red, white and blue signs supporting Trump on Wednesday night ahead of Tuesday's primary. \nThe event was calm compared to some Trump rallies, with protesters banned from the Fairgrounds. \nKnight introduced Trump at the rally, saying he can set the country on the right path. \n\"You will be responsible for the shift into what America should be if you vote for Donald Trump,\" Knight said to the crowd of several thousand strong. \nKevin Knight, an IU graduate student not related to Bobby Knight, attended the rally Wednesday and said he already planned to skip class and see Trump speak, but Bobby Knight's appearance \"sweetened the pot.\" \n\"He's an icon of Indiana history,\" Kevin Knight said. \"Having (Bobby) Knight here is an important way to connect with Hoosiers.\" \nJosh Anderson, South Bend, was wearing an IU sweatshirt at the rally and said Knight and Trump fit together because of their bombastic personalities. \n\"Just like Coach Knight, (Trump) speaks his mind, and I like them both for that,\" Anderson said. \nAfter Trump took the stage at the rally, he focused mainly on trade deals such as NAFTA and the Trans-Atlantic Partnership, which he said make it easier for American manufacturers to move overseas. He specifically called out Carrier, an HVAC manufacturing company that earlier this year announced that the business would move to Mexico, putting nearly 1,400 Hoosier workers out of jobs. \nSeveral former Carrier workers in the crowd called out to Trump, who said his plan to stop manufacturers from moving overseas was to charge a 35 percent tax on every product a company like Carrier ships into the United States. \n\"Then they will call and say, 'President, Carrier has decided to stay in Indiana,\" Trump said to thunderous applause and cheers of \"U-S-A!\" \nTrump's message to support American manufacturing jobs resonated with Mark Hale, who is still has not decided who to vote for Tuesday. Trump will be opposed by Ohio Gov. John Kasich and U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas. \nHale said he wanted to come out to see for himself what Trump was like. But Hale was already sold on Trump's message to \"make America great again,\" by keeping manufacturers from leaving. \nOne of Trump's sons, Donald Trump Jr., briefly took the stage alongside his father, saying America needs someone who has \"spent years signing the front of checks.\" \n\"Bring in someone who understands what job creation is,\" Trump Jr. urged. \"If you think the system is working, then fine. But I don't think a lot of people do. It's time for a change, and no one else is going to work harder for you.\" Sign Up / Sign In With your existing account from... {* loginWidget *}",

      "text": "While we need to continue to train people who can tell machines what to do, it’s important to continue training people to do what machines can’t, like provide quality service with a smile. It’s one thing to say jobs growth will come from the service sector, now that mining has carked it, but you can’t fire an economy from a base of poorly paid baristas or aged care workers.\nOr can you?\nWhen I put it to Saul Eslake that Queensland needed a better-educated populace with a capacity to innovate, the leading economist cautioned me against underestimating low-skilled labour.\n“Far too many people are too inclined to turn their noses up at services’ jobs, deriding them as flipping hamburgers and taking in other people’s washing,” Eslake said following his presentation at the Queensland Jobs Growth Summit in Brisbane this week.\n“There is a pervading view, both conservative and Labor, that it is inherently more noble to make things you can drop on your foot than provide services.\n“We need those low-skilled jobs, people who in decades gone by screwed nuts on Holdens and sewed buttons on shirts.”\nYes, of course, but don’t we need high-level thinkers if Queensland is to compete in a global marketplace where the dominant currency is knowledge? It turns out that we need both.\nHowever, Queensland is not yet in the best position to deliver.\nDeputy Premier Jackie Trad admitted on Tuesday that the government needed to do more to boost employment.\nThere has been modest jobs growth in the state’s south east, but when the mining slump cost another 28,000 full-time positions in regional Queensland last month, and one in three young people outside the big smoke of Brisbane is unemployed, something’s wrong.\nHave we left our run too late? I’d like to think not, but we must act swiftly to harness opportunities in four key pillars — health, education, professional services and accommodation and food services (closely aligned with tourism).\nAccording to The Australia Institute’s Jobs Growth in Queensland report released this month, four in five jobs will be in these service industries.\nThis means highly skilled professionals as well — teachers, nurses, university lecturers, lab technicians — with the key words being “highly skilled”.\nIn the sunshine state we work longer than other Australians, as Eslake has pointed out, but we have lower productivity and lower average wages, partly because our educational outcomes are not up to scratch.\nProspective employees tend to turn their noses up at working in the service industry, a snobbery that has to change. (Pic: iStock) They’re not as bad as in Tasmania, if that’s any consolation, but if we are to achieve wage parity with other eastern states and indeed compete on the world stage, then we need a smarter, more productive and well-equipped workforce.\nStripping it back, this requires quality education that begins in early childhood and continues throughout a person’s working life.\nWe need more of the best teachers and fewer of the fallbacks who couldn’t get into their preferred tertiary course. Teaching must be better valued and remunerated.\nChildren must be actively encouraged to complete Year 12 and to take STEM (science, technology, engineering and maths) subjects and do better in them.\nDr Geoff Garrett, Queensland Chief Scientist, argues that the retention and performance of students in STEM education is critical to the future of young people and Australia’s economy.\nWhile 90 per cent of Year 12 students studied science in the early 90s, by 2011 this number had fallen to less than half. It is still dismally low.\nEnrolment in STEM courses at university is dropping too, with Queensland well below the national average.\nOne side-effect of this is that more than 80 per cent of primary school teachers have no tertiary education in science, Garrett says.\nNo wonder kids are disengaged if teachers can’t grasp or explain concepts.\nAll of this derails the development of a skilled workforce.\nUniversities aren’t the only or necessarily best-suited option for school leavers, so TAFES, apprenticeship schemes and workplace training also must get on board with real-world demands.\nStephen Tait, CEO of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry Queensland, is alarmed at how many of the state’s 406,000 small businesses (which employ the bulk of workers) are not digitally savvy.\nMany don’t have online banking or even a website presence and are not attracting the right people to take their operations forward.\nThere is a massive divide between rural, regional and metropolitan employment opportunities. This must close.\nThe challenge is to properly understand the shifting labour market and for governments and industry leaders to equip people with the skills and pathways to succeed.\nMaking great coffee is a skill — just ask anyone who’s suffered a bad cup — but as economist Jim Minifie, from the Grattan Institute, says we need “old fashioned individual genius too”.\nIn this automated era, we need to train people who can tell machines what to do but, equally, train people to do what machines can’t — coaching, caring and creating strong communities.\nThe ultimate service producers — now that’s a goal for a truly smart state. Come on Queensland, we can do this.\nKylie Lang is an associate editor at The Courier-Mail.\n Don’t underestimate your poorly paid barista",

(Source: WOIO) AKRON, OH (WOIO) - \nThe stress is real this time of year for high school seniors trying to get into their school of choice and for college grads who are trying to land that first job. \nThat stress comes, in a lot of cases, from maneuvering through the interview process. Leslie Ungar of Electric Impulse Communications feels she can help young people, through coaching and manage the interview process with less stress. \nUngar believes preparation is the key to the successful interview, “So how are you going to stand out as someone who can add value to that company or team.” \nFor 18 years Ungar has, as just part of her firm’s business, coached young people on how to handle and interview with poise and confidence, “You have to be able to identify why you’re the best fit and you have to be able to talk about it easily.” Ria Vij is a senior at Copley High School, and she went to Electric Impulse for help at the end of last year, “I knew that I was sort of shy and timid. I just knew communicating was something I was lacking.” \nRia was facing an interview for one of just 6 spots in a prestigious 7 year dental program at the University of the Sciences and Temple University. \nAfter several sessions with Ungar, Ria felt she was ready for the interview portion of the selection process. \n“I knew that I was ready, I guess I could say I knew I could walk into that interview and I had everything she taught me in the back of my head,” Riv said, adding that they had identified and worked on 13 specific keys for her interview.That coaching paid off and Ria was accepted in the program. Ungar’s broad advice for young people facing an interview is “Your enthusiasm, your passion, your energy for this, that’s the value you bring.” \nFollow Cleveland 19 News: \nCopyright 2016 WOIO .

Show Caption Previous Next \nPHOENIX - Four people have been indicted in an employment and credit scam that targeted college students in Arizona, Attorney General Marc Brnovich announced on Thursday. \nThe suspects allegedly posted \"help wanted\" ads on Craigslist for clerical and administrative positions and interviewed applicants, mostly Phoenix-area college students--some attended Arizona State University--looking for part-time work. \nView the indictment here \nThe students were allegedly told they did not have good enough credit for the position and needed to raise their scores because they would be considered \"investors\" in the company. They were given false paystubs and a script and instructed to get a loan from a bank. \nThe victims told detectives they were told the company would re-pay the loans, which would in turn improve the applicants' credit scores. That allegedly didn't happen. The victims said the loans went into default and their credit scores dropped. \nIn total, 12 people were defrauded of $118,000, according to the Attorney General's office. \nOn Thursday, a Grand Jury handed up the indictment and special agents then arrested brothers Aaron Blodgett and Matthew Blodgett, and their alleged associates Zoran Vuckovic and Damir Karadascevic.

      "text": "Raimondo takes plans for education, job skills on tour The governor hosts the first of a series of public discussions Thursday night in Cumberland. Comment Follow @@lborgprojocom Posted Apr. 28, 2016 @ 8:40 pm CUMBERLAND, R.I. — Governor Raimondo promoted her education agenda in Cumberland Thursday night, the first of a series of conversations in which the public will be invited to weigh in on her plans. After the discussion, Raimondo was asked if she needed to engage the public more in light of the negative response to her \"Cooler & Warmer\" tourism campaign. She said the fallout from that campaign was \"a reminder of the fact you have to engage people in everything,\" adding that she wants to be an accessible governor. Raimondo repeated what has become her education stump speech: that a high school diploma should mean something and that Rhode Island's economy depends on what skills are acquired by the next generation. She also outlined her major education proposals: a computer course in every school and making college more affordable by allowing high school students to gain college credits and boosting tuition aid. Raimondo stressed that her budget sets aside additional money for special education and English language learners. And she noted that it tries to level the playing field financially between traditional public schools and charter public schools. Her budget calls for giving school districts an additional $355 per student in state aid to cover costs not borne by charter schools. Districts with more than 5 percent enrollment in charters will receive an additional $300 per student. Although Cumberland officials have been vocal critics of charter schools, that sentiment wasn't widely evident Thursday night. Cumberland School Committee Chairwoman Lisa Beaulieu said that half of all new state education aid goes toward paying non-classroom-related expenditure, including charter school tuition, teacher pensions and transportation costs. Under the funding formula, the money follows the child from the district school to the charter. \"Charter schools will soon be our biggest unfunded mandate,\" she said. \"It's not an equitable situation.\" Raimondo acknowledged that the revised funding formula isn't perfect but said it's a step in the right direction. While charters do draw money away from the traditional school district, charters —and here she singled out Blackstone Valley Prep in northern Rhode Island — are doing \"terrific work.\" \"It's a balancing act,\" she said of the funding formula. On the role that standardized testing plays in education, Raimondo said that as a parent, she likes to know how her children are doing academically. But she also said, \"You can't over-test. I've been frustrated by that myself.\" Just this week, state Education Commissioner Ken Wagner proposed eliminating the Partnership for the Assessment of Readiness for College and Careers, the state's controversial new test, as a graduation requirement, although districts would be allowed to use it as a part of their graduation criteria. Wagner underscored that philosophy Thursday night, saying, \"We need a measure of student progress. However, tests must serve instruction and test preparation isn't good teaching.\" The lack of unstructured play time during the school day has become a hot topic in Rhode Island and nationwide. One Cumberland parent complained that her child is \"bouncing off the walls\" because he gets only 26 minutes a day for recess and lunch. Raimondo agreed but said she doesn't think the problem is best solved by passing legislation. Two bills seeking to mandate recess at the elementary level are before the General Assembly. \"Let's give schools more flexibility,\" Raimondo said. \"Don't regulate it.\" —lborg@providencejournal.com",

      "text": "Raimondo reaches out after toughest month on job 'Cooler & Warmer' debacle was followed by a poll that showed low approval numbers and Clinton's primary defeat Comment Follow @patrickanderso_ Posted Apr. 28, 2016 @ 9:24 pm CUMBERLAND, R.I. — Governor Raimondo can persuade a room, as she showed when making the case to overhaul the state pension system, cut the Medicaid budget and invest tens of millions of dollars in new economic development incentives. Now coming off perhaps her rockiest month since taking office, Raimondo is looking to reconnect with Rhode Islanders who may be skeptical of national magazine features and high-powered fundraisers or concerned she may have lost touch. On Thursday night, Raimondo traveled to Cumberland High School for a town-hall style discussion on education and work-force training, two subjects she has focused on all year, in the first stop of a statewide listening. \"Everything I have done in government, since I have been in government, whether it was pension reform or reinventing Medicaid ... the more you bring people with you, the more successful you will be,\" Raimondo told reporters after the event. \"So clearly with the mistakes with tourism, not bringing stakeholders to the table, was a reminder of that.\" The flubbed roll-out of the state's new tourism marketing campaign and the now-abandoned slogan \"Cooler & Warmer\" kicked off Raimondo's tough month. It ended this week with the heavy Rhode Island presidential primary defeat of Hillary Clinton, for whom Raimondo and most of the state's Democratic establishment had campaigned. In between came the first public poll with Raimondo's job approval ratings, which showed only 31 percent of respondents thought she was doing a good or excellent job. So did Raimondo's message resonate with the 150 or so people who turned out in the Cumberland High School cafeteria? \"Yes and no,\" said Kim Gois, 49, of Cumberland, when asked whether she thought Raimondo was on the right track policy-wise. \"I want a better sense of the direction she is heading.\" Pamela Azar, 58, of Lincoln, said she had come to voice support for charter schools and wanted to find out more about where Raimondo stood on the issue. Even among students there was uncertainty. Cumberland High School senior Christopher Lally, whose business card described him as an entrepreneur and future Babson College student, said he was looking forward to voting for the first time, but couldn't say whether he would vote for Raimondo if she were up for re-election in November. \"What she says tonight will mean a lot,\" Lally said before the event. While the night's tagline was \"upskill Rhode Island,\" the questions from residents largely focused on typical K-12 education issues, such as charter schools, school budgets and high-stakes testing. Some of the discussion touched on issues, such as mandatory recess and changes to the school funding formula, being addressed by the General Assembly as it moves into the heart of legislative season. Asked after the event whether Raimondo had addressed her question about guaranteeing time outdoors during the school day for students, Irena Mandel of Cumberland said the governor had \"sidestepped it.\" Others, such as Jessica Waters, mother of three Cumberland students and Rhode Island Mayoral Academy employee, said she thought Raimondo was listening, even if it was unclear whether she had the policies to solve the state's education challenges. \"This is what we are all about,\" Raimondo said summing up the event with reporters, \"putting forth good proposals and listening to people and getting things done.\"",

      "text": "Law students awarded over $500,000 in grants for public service jobs Grants were given to 126 students by Mairead Crotty | Apr 28 2016 | 1 hour ago Courtesy UVA School of Law \nLee said the expansion of the grant program demonstrates the Law School’s support for its students. \nA total of $514,979 in grants was awarded to 126 Law students to work in public service jobs this summer. This represents a fifty percent increase in funding from last year. \nThe grant program has gradually expanded since it was founded in the early 1980s. \nIn its first year, only six students were awarded grants. This year, the Public Interest Law Association was able to guarantee funding for all eligible students through a partnership with the Mortimer Caplin Public Service Center at the Law School. \nWhile PILA raises money for the grant program through its own fundraisers, this year the Law School Foundation contributed additional funding. \nReedy Swanson, a third-year Law student and president of PILA, said the partnership between PILA and the Public Service Center allowed PILA to expand their grant program significantly. \n“In order to do that, we needed more support from the administration, both financially and administratively,” Swanson said. “Having to work with over a hundred students to get through the application process takes a lot of time. PILA, with the Public Service Center, were able to process a lot more grants, and were able to fund more with the Law School Foundation.” \nAnnie Kim, director of the Mortimer Caplin Public Service Center, said the partnership allowed the groups to combine their individual strengths to better benefit law students. \n“By working together, we were able to bring some of our administrative knowledge while the students were able to bring their historical understanding of how the program worked,” Kim said. “Students were able to get easier access to the application and have the grants paid out quickly.” \nThe main criteria for applicants are a certain number of pro bono or public service volunteer work. First-year Law students must have volunteered for 40 hours by spring break, while second-year Law students must have volunteered for 80 hours. \nIn addition, students who receive grants must volunteer at PILA the following year. \nSecond-year Law student and grant recipient Ryan Snow, who will be working at the Campaign Legal Center in Washington, D.C., said the grant program allows law students who are interested in public service to work for “understaffed and underfunded” companies who often cannot afford to pay their interns. \n“It allows students to gain experience in public service instead of doing something more corporate,” Snow said. “It’s a way to make it less of an opportunity cost for those who want the experience of public service work.” \nSecond-year Law student Jennifer Lee, who will work at Children’s Rights — a nonprofit in New York, will use the grant to offset the cost of her unpaid internship. \nLee said the expansion of the grant program demonstrates the Law School’s support for its students. \n“The grant encourages and supports students to engage in public service work, because it provides financial support and shows that the school supports students interested in public service work,” Lee said. “You also get financial support and guidance from the Public Service Center and the school’s overall support.” \nBecause there is a large interest in legal jobs in the public sector, agencies seek potential employees with experience and an interest in public service. \nThird-year Law student Teresa Hepler, who will use her grant to work with Mecklenburg Public Defenders in Charlotte, N.C., said the PILA grants will better prepare students for the job market. \n“For people who want to do public service jobs, this enables them to get experience doing just that,” Hepler said. “These jobs are pretty competitive, so employers want to see a commitment. These grants allow students to get the experience that they need, and show that they are committed to public service.” \nThird-year Law student and grant recipient Tex Pasley, who will perform legal research for the Sargent Shriver National Center on Poverty Law in Chicago, said the program “opens up a lot of doors for students who want to do public service work long-term.” \n“If you want to work after graduation in a public service job, whether in the government or public sector, to get those jobs you need to show you have experience from working in those types of jobs during law school,” Pasley said. “It helps students who are interested in working in public service, while ensuring that they can pay rent in a place like New York City or Washington, D.C. where those jobs are available.” Published April 28, 2016 in News",

Buy Now CASEY PAGE/Gazette Staff \nEmily Killham of Great Falls learns CPR during a workshop as part of the Jobs for Montana Graduates conference at the Radisson Hotel on Thursday. \nAbout 300 high school students from around the state gathered in Billings on Wednesday and Thursday for the Jobs for Montana Graduates IGNITE Conference. \nStudents learned about an array of careers and competed in competitive events over two days at the Radisson Hotel, formerly the Holiday Inn Grand. \nMorning workshops Thursday ranged from how to prepare healthy, affordable meals to a primer on smokejumping. \nSmokejumper Caleb Allen-Schmid offered the sort of tips not found in brochures. \n“In the winter, when there’s no wildfires, we do a lot of sewing,” he said, talking about preparing gear. \nHe had a table full of equipment to show students, and told them that jumping into a wildfire doesn’t have much in common with commercial skydiving. \n“We never know where we’re gonna jump until we get to a fire,” he said, explaining that jumpers land using a “glorified shoulder roll.” \nYellowstone County Extension Agent Jackie Rumph showed students how to combine common foods to create quick, healthy meals using versatile recipes — even with the likes of ramen noodles. \n“You can always add a little bit less or a little bit more depending on what sounds good to you,” she said. \nShe offered students tips on how the make the most of their purchases, such as the minimal nutritional differences between fresh and frozen vegetables. \n“If you buy which is the more affordable, you’re not really shorting yourself nutrition,” she said. \nIn a session led by Shani Rich of the Area Health Education Center, students learned CPR. \n“We don’t wait until we’re in an emergency situation,” she said. “That’s why we practice.” \nStudents practiced chest-pumping techniques timed to the beat of the Bee Gees' \"Stayin’ Alive.\" \n“Two minutes is a really, really long time when you’re doing this,” Rich said. “This is your morning workout.” \nSessions were designed to both expose students to careers and to build life skills. \n“It’s awesome for thinking about a wide range of jobs,” said Fromberg junior Cory Struthers. \nJobs for Montana Graduates is a Department of Labor initiative that can be taught as a middle or high school course, helping students gain employable skills, educating them about career options and leadership and civic awareness — with a major focus on keeping students in school through graduation. \n“JMG’s probably one of my favorite classes,” Fromberg junior Eugene Barker said. “You’re not constantly sitting in a room.” Tags",

Dulaney Center Thursday. \nHundreds of job seekers flooded the Tommy E. Dulaney Center Thursday in search of a job at the 14th Annual Career Expo and Job Fair hosted by The Radio People and Meridian Community College. \nThis was the third year the fair was conducted at the Tommy E. Dulaney Center and the first year for the Meridian Community College's Health Education and Nursing Division to join the event, said Shannon Coleman, MCC's job placement and career specialist. \n\"We are excited to offer this opportunity to our students and to our community every year,\" said Coleman. \n\"We usually have a separate job fair for our health education and and nursing division, but they joined us this year to do one big job fair. A lot are graduating in May and that's why we chose this time of year to do it, to help them find employment using their degree.\" \nRadio People General Manager Bryan Holladay said the fair gets bigger and better every year. \n\"We had over 45 different companies represented here, and people continued to come into the doors throughout the day,\" Holladay said. \"It was a great opportunity for people to come in and see what jobs are available in Meridian, and also a great opportunity for businesses to meet a lot of different job candidates all at one time.\" \nJob seekers varied from students, to the unemployed, to the employed looking for a better job. \nMaricela Albarez, a nursing student at MCC, said she came to the fair to see what is available in the health care field. \n\"I am working toward getting a higher education, and there are a lot of opportunities out there, so I wanted to see what I might be interested in,\" Alvarez said. \nEddie Roberson, Sr., of Meridian said the job fairs are a meal ticket for him. \n\"I am experienced in doing a lot of things, mostly production type jobs,\" Roberson said. \"It gives me ideas of what I might want to do next, I've worked at Nissan, drove a truck, and can use a forklift, so I am qualified for many things.\" \nRepresentatives from industries such as law enforcement, military, automotive, healthcare, education, fire service, call centers, and direct sale companies were on hand to take applications and screen potential candidates. \nMeridian Police Department Sgt. John Griffith and Meridian Fire Marshall Jason Collier were on hand to provide information about soon to be job openings in their departments. \n\"We will be hiring police officers in about two months,\" Griffith said. \"If you are interested go to Civil Service at City Hall to put in your application.\" \nCollier said the application period is open until May 23 for entry level firefighter. \n\"The next couple of months we will have openings for a diesel mechanic apprentice, and a couple of positions for fire prevention specialists also,\" Collier said. \nNew to the job fair was Firestone Complete Auto Care; Area Manager Rick Herring said the business was excited to be a part of the fair this year. \n\"We were excited about the opportunity to partner up and get some new blood in our stores, and provide employment opportunities to local students who are pursuing a career in technology,\" he said. \nColeman said a workshop was held prior to the fair for those in the community looking for employment. \n\"We discussed with them how to dress for success to make a lasting impression, how to do a good polished resume, and how to interview with confidence,\" Coleman said. \"The more prepared you are, the more successful you will be.\" Sign Up / Sign In With your existing account from... {* loginWidget *}",

(AP Photo/Mark Humphrey) SPRING HILL (AP) — General Motors is investing $790 million at its plant in Tennessee and another $118 million in Michigan. The company said Wednesday that it will create nearly 800 jobs at the Spring Hill Manufacturing Plant as part of the new high-efficiency engine program and other modernization initiatives. The automaker’s 2015 contract with the United Auto Workers union said that Spring Hill would receive at least 700 new jobs as part of $1.9 billion in investments in U.S. facilities during the four-year agreement. The Spring Hill complex south of Nashville has about 2,300 hourly employees, according to GM’s website. It makes the new Cadillac XT5 midsize SUV and two four-cylinder engines. It will start producing the GMC Acadia midsize SUV later this spring. State bill on counseling blamed for visitor absence OLYMPIA, Wash. — The Washington secretary of state says no one from her office will attend a national conference in Tennessee in part because of a bill signed by the governor there allowing counselors to refuse to treat patients based on the therapist’s religious or personal beliefs. Republican Secretary of State Kim Wyman said in a statement Wednesday that after consideration she will not go to the National Association of Secretaries of State summer meeting. She also cited the state primary election happening shortly after the meeting and modernizing state systems as reasons for her to stay in Washington state. Supporters say the bill protects the rights of therapists and allows them to refer patients to more appropriate counselors. State cancels deal with testing company NASHVILLE — The state of Tennessee on Wednesday abruptly terminated a $107.7 million contract with a testing company following repeated failures with the rollout of the new assessment called TNReady. State Education Commissioner Candice McQueen said the state had been forced to suspend student testing in grades 3 through 8 because the company had not been able to ship the test materials to students on time. McQueen described the relationship between the state and North Carolina-based testing company Measurement Inc. as “tumultuous,” and said the company’s contract was terminated after it revised its deadline for shipping the tests to students three times in April. The state no longer had faith that kids would get the tests by May 10, she said, and education officials didn’t want to go beyond that date because they didn’t want to interrupt school trips, field days and fun events normally planned for kids at the end of the school year. “The failure of this vendor has let down the teachers and students of our state,” McQueen said. The TNReady test has been hailed as a smarter assessment that better gauges a student’s critical-thinking skills, but the delivery of the test has been plagued by problems. The assessment was originally designed to be taken online. But computer glitches prevented students from taking the test on the first day of state testing in February. Afterward, McQueen ordered the tests to be given the old-fashioned way — with paper and pencil. But a total of 2 million documents have yet to be shipped as of Wednesday, McQueen said. Kyles, witness to King assassination, dies at 81 MEMPHIS — The Rev. Samuel Billy Kyles, a longtime civil rights leader who was present when Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated on a hotel balcony, has died in Memphis. He was 81. Erica Cunningham, an administrative assistant at Monumental Baptist Church in Memphis, where Kyles served as pastor for 55 years, said he died Tuesday at a hospital. An official cause of death was not immediately released, but Cunningham said he had been living with dementia. Kyles’ family is expected to release a statement later. King came to Memphis in 1968 to help striking sanitation workers, who were seeking safer working conditions and better pay. At about 6 p.m. on April 4, King, Kyles and others prepared to leave the Lorraine Motel to go to dinner. “I said, guys, come on let’s go. We have a rally after dinner,” Kyles told The Associated Press in a 2008 interview. “I turned and walked away, got a few steps, a few feet, and that’s when I heard the shot.” The .30-caliber bullet hit King, who was on a balcony with Kyles and others. “Blood was everywhere,” Kyles recalled. Kyles was the subject of a 2008 documentary short film about the assassination, “The Witness: From the Balcony of Room 306.” The film was nominated for an Academy Award. ×",

      "text": "Job well done: Team of Islanders successful in reclaiming River Lea artifact Fri, Apr 29th 2016 02:25 pm The addition of a stone well recovered from the Niagara River earlier this year by LDC Construction adds to the historic appeal of River Lea, the beautiful mansion at Beaver Island State Park. The recovery was a project spearheaded by Island resident Paul Leuchner, a retired Army Corps of Engineers biologist. \nBy Karen Carr Keefe \nContributor \nA century-old well that time forgot and the Niagara River nearly claimed has been restored to its rightful place on the lawn of the River Lea mansion. \nOn Feb. 2, Jeff Dinsmore and his crew from LDC Construction did the heavy lifting, raising the 6-ton well with an excavator and carefully transporting it via trailer to its new - and former - home. \nIslander Paul Leuchner waited anxiously on shore that sunny winter day as he watched a decades-old dream come true. \nThe soggy saga of the well's trip back to dry land began 20 years ago as Leuchner's one-man campaign to restore the historic artifact. But Leuchner gives ample credit and thanks to a team of Grand Island volunteers that is still writing the final chapters in 2016. The cast of characters in this tale includes an award-winning construction crew; a park manager moonlighting as a volunteer roofer; and a stonemason and his son who also have strong ties to Beaver Island State Park. \nWhy did Jeff Dinsmore volunteer his LDC Construction crew and equipment for the well recovery project? \"Paul asked me to - it's pretty much that simple,\" Dinsmore said. \nHe said he told Leuchner, 'I can get it moved - and we did.' LDC did the work for free because there were no funds for the project. Dinsmore said, \"It won't be pretty.\" But after the work was done, he said, \"It went a lot smoother than we thought it would.\" A grinding stone, brought to the site and placed on a steel base as part of an Eagle Scout project facilitated by Ricky Hoover in 2014. Finding the Well \nLeuchner first noticed the stone well - half-submerged in the waters off River Lea - while he was kayaking in the 1990s. Later, he pointed it out to colleagues returning on a state barge after doing restoration work on Strawberry Island. \"What's with this well over here?\" he recalls asking. His question turned into a quest. \nIn 1999, Leuchner proposed a plan for recovery of the old well. At the time, he worked for the Army Corps of Engineers Buffalo District Office. \"Although there was some interest, no funds could be found to implement this project,\" he said Project Approval, But No Funding \nSeveral more attempts were made over the years, but it was not until Leuchner's appointment to the Niagara River Greenway Commission that he was able to persuade the state office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation to endorse the project. \nThe plan was refined in meetings with parks officials and members of the Grand Island Historical Society. The State Historic Preservation office gave approval in 2013 to proceed with the recovery of the old well. \nBut funding was still a problem. Volunteers to the Rescue \n\"Thankfully, LDC came forward and volunteered to take it out at no cost to anybody,\" Leuchner said. \"They basically performed a really, really useful and positive community service here, and it was very nice of them to engage all their equipment and their entire workforce for almost a whole day.\" \n\"They were very caring and did a very clean operation,\" Leuchner said. It was \"a carefully orchestrated lifting and transport operation,\" he said. \"They caused no disturbance in the river.\" But beforehand, Leuchner had worried about the risks posed by the age and condition of the artifact. \"We all stood there with our fingers crossed, they started the lift and it came out in one giant block; not a piece fell out of it. And now it's an artifact that they can interpret and it becomes part of the historic setting there for River Lea.\" Friendship Paved the Way \nLeuchner and Dinsmore's friendship was forged a couple of years ago when they were both part of a Buffalo Launch Club lecture series on Niagara River islands. LDC is the Chamber of Commerce 2016 \"Environmental Stewards of the Year,\" honoring the company's 15 years of restoration work on every island in the Niagara River except the Canadian-owned Navy Island. \nBefore the well could be relocated, a right of way had to be established for heavy equipment access. Island resident Steve Birtz and Leuchner spent several weekends clearing a path to the waterfront. \"We selected a right of way that would avoid any kind of environmental impact,\" Leuchner said. Successful Recovery \nFinally, on Feb. 2, the day arrived for the recovery of the old well from the river. Dinsmore and the LDC crew arrived early in the morning. By 1:30 p.m. that same day, they completed the entire project, and Paul Leuchner could breathe a sigh of relief. \n\"Well it's kind of a sense of accomplishment,\" Leuchner said. \"It's been a long time of negotiating, and doing site investigation work and then trying to get sources of funding to try to get it moved.\" \nThere was another environmental concern that dictated aspects of the siting. \"They put it on two pieces of plywood because the state Historic Preservation officer made it very clear that we could put it on the property,\" Leuchner said. \"We could recover it, but we were not allowed to dig on the grounds of River Lea because there could be some historically significant artifacts in the soil there,\" Leuchner said. Stonemasons Volunteer \nFunding concerns were further eased when stonemasons John Anderson and his son, Tyler, of Grand Island, agreed to restore stones that were knocked from the well base when ravaged by years of Niagara River ice scouring. They volunteered their time because John Anderson's father, Russell, was a longtime manager of Beaver Island State Park, Leuchner said. \nOnce the base is completed, soil will be brought in to raise the land surface around the perimeter of the structure so it is easier to look into the interior of the well, Leuchner said. Recycled paving stones from elsewhere in Beaver Island State Park will be placed to provide access off the main path to the River Lea home. Roof - the Crowning Touch \n\"A replica of the original well roof, fabricated and donated by Andy Hillman, Beaver Island Park manager, will be the crowning touch and the last step of this extraordinary project,\" Leuchner said. \nHillman said he has completed the roof. \"It did turn out rather well,\" he said. He said there is somewhat limited information about the appearance of the original well roof. \"It's not really discernible in a lot of the pictures.\" \nTo make it authentic, he duplicated the pitch of the roof and the trusses. Because the well is stone, he said a slate roof \"would look rather authentic.\" \nIt can be installed once it is stabilized and the bottom stone is restored. Because of the resulting weight of the roof, he said he would use a forklift to put it in place. \nHillman, park manager since 2011, has worked for the park service for 22 years. \"I've had some experience with roofing when I was younger, dealing with patches on a slate roof.\" Historical Society Pleased \nFormer town supervisor Mary Cooke was at River Lea Feb. 2 taking photos and watching the well project unfold. At the time, she also expressed doubts about the stability of the artifact. \n\"Paul was rightfully concerned that it would disintegrate,\" she said. But all went well, so to speak. \n\"It was a neat experience,\" Cooke said. \"Just to watch LDC at work was incredible. It made me appreciate what Paul and LDC accomplished.\" \nCooke is corresponding secretary of the Grand Island Historical Society and a longtime member of their Education Committee. She said the project is significant to Grand Island residents. \n\"It adds another exhibit, a nice area of interest that can be accessed even if River Lea is not open,\" Cooke said. \n\"Paul really did a yeoman's job on pulling the well project together,\" said Barbara Birt, library chairperson for the Historical Society. \"It's a great contribution for our premises.\" \nSociety President Curt Nestark said that when Leuchner proposed the well recovery, \"I suggested that he take on the project. He agreed, and Andy Hillman and Jeff Dinsmore were the lead elements. I can't thank them enough,\" he said. \"I'm very happy that they were able to rescue it before the ice in the river (eventually) swallowed it up.\" The Wishing Well \nOnce soil is graded around the base and there's a roof atop the well, there are plans for it to be made into a wishing well for visitors, with the coins going toward River Lea's upkeep and preservation. \"Those pennies have a way of adding up,\" Nestark said. \nThey already are, Leuchner said. \"People have already gone down there and thrown money in the middle of it,\" he said. \"It will be an interesting attraction there.\" River Lea as an Educational Venue \nNestark added that the society has other plans in the works to enhance the site, including bringing Schoolhouse No. 5 to River Lea from its current location near Kelly's Country Store on Grand Island Boulevard. \nCooke said the area on River Lea's front lawn is progressing as an educational venue. There is a grinding stone on the left and the well on the right. Making a frame for the grinding stone placement was an Eagle Scout project in 2014 by Ricky Hoover. An all-weather interpretive sign eventually will be added for the two artifacts, Cooke said. The Historical Society has acquired some vintage farm equipment and carriage wheels that may be part of a permanent outdoor display at River Lea. \nRiver Lea is described by the Historical Society as a beautifully furnished museum dedicated to Grand Island's rich history and to Grover Cleveland, who paid many visits to Allenton Farm as the nephew of Mr. and Mrs. Lewis F. Allen. The Allens founded the farm in the 1800s and built River Lea as a summer home. Among its many treasures are an extensive collection of vintage clothing, Indian arrowheads, photographs, and antique kitchen and farm implements. The Historical Society holds annual spring bus tours for all Island fourth-graders. The students and their teachers have the opportunity to view historic landmarks across the Island while a society docent describes what they are seeing. At the same time, they also visit River Lea where they can inspect all of the rooms and listen to the docents explain details of historic artifacts, pictures, clothing and more. The LDC Construction crew poses near the well they recovered Feb. 2 from the Niagara River and moved into place at the River Lea mansion. From left, they are: Lyle Szapakowski, Greg Dinsmore, Mike Szapakowski, Jeff Dinsmore and Dan Dinsmore. Related Articles",

        "title": "Worcester may sue state over mistake in school aid \nMA_Worcester_Telegram WORCESTER – City and school officials are exploring their options – including possibly litigation – to get the state to fix a mistake they said it made in its inflation calculations six years ago, which would net Worcester an extra $12 million in education aid next year.\nAt a joint meeting on Monday, members of the School Committee and City Council agreed to seek the city law office’s advice on whether a statute of limitations would apply in any legal attempt to recoup that money. The School Committee agreed to accept the report of that meeting and the recommendation at its meeting on Thursday night. Councilor-At-Large Morris Bergman, who attended Monday’s meeting, said the request would go before the City Council at its meeting next Tuesday.\nAt the heart of the district’s case is a discrepancy in the state’s inflation factor setting procedure that originated in the latter half of 2010. Brian Allen, the schools’ chief financial and operations officer, said the state should have set the inflation rate at about 6.7 percent at the time.\n“That’s when the economy was going in the tank,” he said. “So the state said, ‘Yikes.’”\nState officials ended up skipping that quarter entirely, and at the end of the year set the inflation factor at around 3 percent, according to Mr. Allen. Since the inflation factor is based on previous inflation rates, that 3.7 percent difference has persisted across the last six years, resulting in incorrectly low rates, Worcester officials say.\nThe city schools would substantially benefit from the corrected higher inflation factor this year, as the district faces a projected $21 million shortfall in its fiscal 2017 budget – a gap that was exacerbated by a rare negative inflation factor this year. The inflation rate is one of two major elements, along with student enrollment, that determine the state’s aid amount to local districts each year, Mr. Allen said. Restoring the skipped 2010 quarter would amount to an extra $12 million in Worcester’s chapter 70 funding, he estimated.\nA month ago, he pleaded Worcester’s case to dozens of lawmakers at the Statehouse. “There was some interest” from the people there in the inflation factor issue, he said, but it amounted to nothing in the House budget, which excluded the inflation factor adjustment, as well as every other change to the state’s school funding formula that was proposed by a legislative task force last year.\n“We’ve been trying to get that mistake changed” for years, said Glenn Koocher, executive director of the Massachusetts Association of School Committees.\nThe current inflation factor is ultimately inaccurate, he added, considering the increase in prices public schools in the state still have to pay for services and goods.\nLike Mr. Allen, he considers the skipped quarter in 2010 a “technical issue” that could be fixed simply by adjusting the current inflation factor to include the excluded percentage from 2010. But it’s been a hard sell to state officials, especially this year, where there isn’t much room in the budget for the roughly $160 million that adjustment would cost the state.\n“Worcester’s the first (city raising the issue) that’s come to my attention,” Mr. Koocher said, who added the city in general “does a much better job at tracking money than most districts do.”\nMr. Bergman, however, said he was “shocked” to learn about the problem for the first time at Monday’s meeting.\n“I put my lawyer’s cap on – there’s usually a six-year statute of limitations in breach of contract situations,” he said, although he added he wasn’t sure exactly what could be done in the specific case of the state's inflation factor.\n“Moe raised the question – can we at least ask the law department (for the city)?” said School Committee member Jack Foley, who also was at Monday’s meeting.\nMr. Foley added he could see Worcester trying to bring other towns and cities adversely affected by the inflation factor into its effort to raise the issue with the state – “we’d certainly have better standing,” he said.\nWhile he didn’t have much hope in a legal action being effective, Mr. Koocher also believes Worcester’s attempt to highlight the problem can only help.\n“Anything you can throw out in the public discourse during budget season raises awareness,” he said, adding he is still hopeful the state Senate, which has yet to release its recommended budget for next year, will incorporate the inflation factor fix, as well as other funding formula changes, into its spending plan.\nScott O’Connell can be reached at Scott.O’Connell@telegram.com.

Advertisement Local businesses invited to participate in job fair at LSC-Kingwood By Houston Community Newspapers \nCollege students and the public looking for employment or a different career path are invited to explore their options at Lone Star College-Kingwood. \nThe college’s Career Services department will hold a Community Job Fair on Wednesday, May 18 from 2-4 p.m. in the Student Conference Center (SCC). Local businesses that are currently hiring full-time, part-time, internships and seasonal employees are invited to participate. \n“We are excited to connect our May 2016 graduates with local career opportunities,” said Kim Hammond, career services employment specialist. “But, we also have many dedicated students looking for summer internships, and others searching for part-time and full-time jobs while they work their way through college.” \nParticipation in the event is free, but registration is required. To qualify, businesses must have a store front/office location and pay an hourly wage. (Businesses conducted from a home office and businesses with commission-only positions are asked not to participate in this event.) \n“This is a great forum to connect with LSC-Kingwood students and recruit a local work force,” said Jill Todd, career services program manager. Hammond added, “While our job fairs focus on local employment opportunities for students, they are also open to the public.” \nSpace is limited and early registration is recommended. To register for the Community Job Fair, contact Kim Hammond at 281-312-1624 or email .",

      "text": "Published April 29, 29, FOX HOST: And welcome to \"Hannity.\" And we are in beautiful Indianapolis, in Indiana, at the Indiana War Memorial tonight. Now, for the entire hour, we're joined by Senator Ted Cruz and his new vice presidential running mate, Carly Fiorina. We have a large audience. Welcome, all of you.\n(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)\nHANNITY: (INAUDIBLE) Ted Cruz supporters (INAUDIBLE) Wow. I wonder...\n(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)\nHANNITY: Are there any...\n(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)\nAUDIENCE: Cruz! Cruz! Cruz!\n(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)\nHANNITY: I don't even think Larry Bird would get that kind of reaction. Welcome, Indiana. Thank you so much for having us in your city tonight. It's an honor to be here.\nSenator, good to see you again. We appreciate you being back on the program.\nSEN. TED CRUZ, R-TEXAS, Sean, thank you.\nHANNITY: Carly Fiorina, welcome back to you. All right, we got to ask the obvious question. Tell us about the process that brought you two together and make this announcement.\nCRUZ: Well, sure. You know, it really is the perhaps the most solemn and serious decision that any presidential candidate makes is choosing a vice presidential nominee because you're really -- you're telling the American people this is a person who's prepared to lead the country. This is a person who you can trust to honor the promises we're making to defend -- to preserve, protect and defend the Constitution. And -- and...\n(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)\nCRUZ: And critically, this is a person who is prepared to step in and be commander-in-chief and keep this country safe and defend us from our enemies both foreign and domestic.\n(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)\nHANNITY: Carly, you have -- you've been out on the campaign trail. I've interviewed you with Senator Cruz before. I have said this publicly when you were running, after you got out of the race. I do think you've been one of the most effective people of the 17 in prosecuting the case against Hillary Clinton, taking her on very boldly.\n(APPLAUSE)\nHANNITY: Are you -- are you convinced, ultimately, she is the opponent for the Republicans, or do you think she's in an orange jumpsuit and shoes without laces?\n(LAUGHTER)\nCARLY FIORINA, R-CALI., FMR. Well, look, when Ted Cruz is the president of the United States...\n(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)\nFIORINA: ... I suspect that Hillary Clinton will be prosecuted. But until then, I suspect she'll be the nominee of the Democrat Party, which is something I've always said is going to happen. And...\nHANNITY: We do have an update on that. The attorney general, Loretta Lynch, earlier today said, just like James Comey, there's no deadline as it relates to the investigation.\nFIORINA: I rest my case! I rest my case! So the -- you know, the investigation is going to go on and on and on and on and on, and then on November 5th, the new president-elect will say, I'd like an update on that case, please.\n(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)\nFIORINA: You know, I just have to say that...\nHANNITY: Hillary may have to pardon herself.\n(LAUGHTER)\nHANNITY: If she ever won.\nFIORINA: Well, but...\nHANNITY: She's not going to win. Don't worry. All right.\nFIORINA: Yes, you know why she's not going to win? You know why she's not going to win? Because Ted is going to win. And the reason...\n(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)\nFIORINA: The reason Ted is going to win is because think about the contrast. Think about the sharp contrast between Cruz and Fiorina and Clinton and Trump.\nNow, why do I put them together? Clinton and Trump. Because they're two sides of the same coin, Sean. They're two sides of the same coin.\n(APPLAUSE)\nFIORINA: They are both -- they are both the ultimate insiders. I mean, wow, John Boehner says yesterday that Donald Trump is his texting and golfing buddy, and Harry Reid thinks Donald Trump's OK, too. And Donald Trump contributed seven times to Hillary Clinton.\nI'm sorry, it is not a choice or a contrast when Donald Trump agrees with Hillary Clinton on so many positions. Yes, he's OK with the Iranian nuclear deal. Yes, he's OK with single-payer health care. Yes, he was OK until he wasn't on partial-birth abortion. You go on and on and on.\nHow long have Republicans and conservatives said we can only win by presenting a clear contrast? So here it is, people of Indiana, Cruz/Fiorina, Trump/Clinton.\n(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)\nHANNITY: You mentioned John Boehner. And I'm a commentator. I had strong words to say about him yesterday. I'm pretty ticked off because as speaker, he would not fight the Obama agenda. He did not use his constitutional authority, the power of the purse.\nWhile he was speaker, he allowed Obama to accumulate $4.1 trillion in debt. They would not repeal those parts of \"Obama care\" that they could. You stood for 22 hours, Senator. And then he calls...\n(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)\nHANNITY: And then he calls -- and then he called you a miserable SOB, over his dead body would you be elected, and he compared you to Satan.\n(CROSSTALK)\nCRUZ: Look, I give him credit...\nHANNITY: I have a couple of candidates I might go there with, but I'm not going to mention who.\nCRUZ: Listen, I give Boehner credit for imagery.\n(LAUGHTER)\nCRUZ: I suppose the speaker was letting out his inner Trump.\n(LAUGHTER, APPLAUSE)\nCRUZ: But you know, those comments reveal everything you need to know about Washington. Listen, we don't have two parties in Washington. We have one corrupt bipartisan mess in Washington!\n(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)\nHANNITY: I agree with that.\nCRUZ: It's not just that Boehner allowed Obama to run up trillions in debt. Boehner funded it all. Boehner led the effort.\nAnd you know, it was striking in Boehner's comment, he praised Hillary Clinton and he praised Donald Trump. He said, Donald is my friend, we go texting, we go golfing, he's my buddy. And the one person he had vitriol and venom for is me. And I don't know John Boehner. I don't think we've said 50 words to each other in our lives.\nHANNITY: You didn't represent him? Because that was a big issue in...\nCRUZ: Oh, sure. Look, I was a junior lawyer. My boss was hired to be his lawyer. So I worked on the case. I worked on some appellate briefs.\nHANNITY: So you didn't know him.\nCRUZ: I don't know that I even met him. I have never -- we haven't said 50 words to each other in our lives. I was a baby lawyer a couple of years out of law school working on editing some briefs and helping write them, but I don't know the man. And here's the point...\nHANNITY: I don't think we need lectures from a guy that gives us an extra $4.1 trillion in debt, right?\n(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)\nCRUZ: But it's actually -- Sean, it's very revealing. What Boehner is so angry with -- not anything I've ever said to him, it's the fact that I stood up and said, I'm going to honor the promises I made to the men and women who elected me. I'm going to fight to stop ObamaCare. I'm going to fight stop the debt.\n(APPLAUSE)\nCRUZ: I'm going to fight to stop amnesty. And what happened is House conservatives rose up with me and said, We're going to honor our commitments, as well. It's why Boehner lost his job is because House conservatives rose up and said, Stop having a speaker...\n(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)\nCRUZ: ... who funds Obama. And the critical thing to understand is John Boehner and Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump are all part of the same corrupt system. It's why Donald Trump writes checks to Boehner and Hillary.\nAnd if you want to change the system -- you know, one of the greatest frauds in modern electoral history is Donald Trump pretending to be an outsider when he has funded liberal Democrats, when he funded John Boehner. He gave John Boehner, $100,000, his super-PAC, just a few years ago and he is enmeshed with the corruption.\nTrump is texting Boehner? You know what? I don't have Boehner's cell phone, and I'm perfectly OK with that!\n(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)\nFIORINA: Can I say one thing? Look, the American people are angry.\nYou're ticked. I'm ticked. We're all ticked because guess what? The system isn't working for us anymore. It works if you're big, you're powerful, you're wealthy, you're well connected. It doesn't work for anyone else.\nNow, I have to say, as someone who's fought systems all my life -- that's how you go from secretary to CEO. You challenge the system. You challenge the status quo. I am so tired of people attacking Ted Cruz because guess what? You know who attacks Ted Cruz? The people whose status quo he's challenging.\n(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)\nFIORINA: Let me tell you something. Let me tell you something. If you're going to challenge a system -- and this system needs challenging. If you're going to challenge the status quo, if you're going to challenge the well-connected and the wealthy and the powerful, you're going to make enemies.\nSo you know what? I have come to know this man exceedingly well over the last seven weeks. I know him as a friend, as a husband, as a father, and as a great leader. And I for one am exceptionally proud of the enemies he has made!\n(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)\nHANNITY: We'll take a break. We're just getting started with Senator Ted Cruz and his vice presidential running mate, Carly Fiorina. They will be with us the entire hour.\nAnd later tonight, we're going to take a lot of questions from this very, very sedate -- actually, it's a very lively audience. It's \"Hannity\" on the road in Indiana as we continue.\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n(NEWSBREAK)\n \"Hannity.\" And tonight, we're coming to you from Indianapolis, Indiana. Senator Ted Cruz and his running mate, Carly Fiorina, are with us for the hour.\n(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)\nHANNITY: I want to welcome to the audience -- we've got about 60 kids from Morris Hill high school. Morris Hill? All right -- from high school that actually cut school today with the permission of their teacher, which never happened to me in my entire life. Congratulations. We welcome you young people to the event tonight.\n(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)\nHANNITY: So we continue. All right, you know, there are a couple -- I pointed out -- and Senator, usually before these events, I come out and say hi to the crowd, as I always do, and I saw a number of really cute young people, including little Anabelle (ph) over there. And I said this election is about them.\nCRUZ: Yes.\nHANNITY: We now have one in four American families that don't have a single person in the labor force, 95 million Americans out of the labor force, 50 million in poverty, 46 million on food stamps. And Obama will accumulate more debt than every other president before him combined.\nCRUZ: Yes.\nHANNITY: I look at those numbers, and to me it seems almost unfixable.\nCRUZ: Well, there's no doubt that the Obama/Clinton economy is a train wreck. It is a disaster. And millions of people are hurting. And the single most important issue in this election is how we turn that around.\nI can tell you, my top priority as president will be bringing back jobs and economic growth, bringing jobs back to America, bringing manufacturing jobs back to Indiana, raising wages for working men and women, expanding opportunity for young people.\nAnd you know, this election provides a clear contrast. One of the reasons why I named Carly early right now is to provide a clear choice for the voters, for the voters of Indiana, a clear choice between a campaign that is based on yelling and screaming and cursing and insults, versus a positive, optimistic, forward-looking conservative campaign based on real policy solutions. It's one thing to yell about jobs.\nIt's another thing to know how you bring them back. And you know, it was one of the things Ronald Reagan understood, and actually, before him, John F. Kennedy understood, that the key to jobs is you cut taxes, you lift regulations on small businesses, and you see millions of new jobs.\nWe've seen that here in Indiana with Governor Mitch Daniels, with Governor Mike Pence, but we need to bring Indiana values to the country.\n(APPLAUSE)\nHANNITY: And obviously, you're pleased with Governor Pence today, and a lot has happened today for you and your campaign. But the reality is, conservative governors -- and I can mention Scott Walker and John Kasich and Rick Perry and Bobby Jindal and Rick Scott of Florida -- they have done a great job. They've taken high deficits, turned it into surpluses, high unemployment rates. They brought hundreds of thousands of jobs to their states.\nBut Washington Republicans, Carly, have failed. They have not been able to duplicate that. Why is there this fear, this unnatural -- it seems, you know, unpredictable fear or almost pathological that they're going to get blamed for government shutdown if they stand on principle?\nFIORINA: It's called lack of courage and leadership.\n(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)\nFIORINA: That's what it's called. That's what it's called. Look, you know, one of the things that I did before I voted for Ted Cruz -- and I voted for him before I ever had a conversation with...\nHANNITY: Were you on the ballot?\nFIORINA: ... about endorsing -- yes, I was still on the ballot when I voted for Ted Cruz.\n(APPLAUSE)\nFIORINA: One of the things I did before I voted for him, before I endorsed him, before I with great humility and pride accepted his invitation to serve as his running mate, is I went through and read all his policies.\nAnd you know, it's not rocket science why jobs leave and it's not rocket science why they come back. We know what works. We know what works. You have to lower taxes. You have to compete hard for every job. You have to lift ObamaCare and the EPA and this just crushing weight of regulation off the backs in particular of small businesses because it is small businesses that create two thirds of the new jobs in this country.\nBut to do all those things that obviously work -- we've seen it over and over again, to your point -- to do those things that obviously work, guess what? You have to be willing to challenge the system that has been in place for so long that says, No, no, no, we're just going to keep raising taxes, keep rolling back regulations!\n(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)\nFIORINA: You know what? Ask yourselves a question. Why is the Constitution so important? Because the Constitution tells us what is going to work in this country.\nLet me just pick one example, is regulations. We are no longer a rule -- a nation of laws. We are a nation of rules. And ask yourself who are the rule makers? Unaccountable, unelected bureaucrats, nameless, faceless, bureaucrats.\n(APPLAUSE)\nFIORINA: And that machinery has been in place in Washington, D.C., for 30- plus years, and Republicans and Democrats have not stopped it! This is a guy with the courage and the policies and the platforms and the leadership to stand in the breach and say, Enough, we're rolling it back.\n(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)\nHANNITY: Let me turn to the process questions. I'd rather speak more on substance, but these are important questions. The task you have in front of you to win the nomination is daunting. I'm sure you both read the numbers. The current delegate count is Donald Trump 996. You're in second place, 566. He won 27 contests. You won 11 contests. Marco Rubio's won three. John Kasich has won one.\nSo really, it has been a two-person race for a long time. That is a big gap to bridge, a big gap for you to bridge delegate-wise. How important is Indiana? Is it a must-win state for you now?\nCRUZ: Listen, Indiana is critically important. We have seen -- Donald has had a good week. He won his home state and he won the adjoining states, and the media has treated that with hosannas and great astonishments.\n(LAUGHTER)\nCRUZ: Now, of course, the preceding three weeks, we had won five states in a row. We had won starting with Utah...\n(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)\nCRUZ: ... then North Dakota, then Wisconsin, then Colorado and Wyoming. You know, in those five states -- 1.3 million people voted in those five states, and we won landslide after landslide after landslide.\nSo listen, it's fine that Donald did well in the Northeast, in the Acela corridor, and he -- where -- he did well there, but we're back in the heartland. And you know, one of the real differences...\n(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)\nCRUZ: Both Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton view Indiana as flyover territory. This is not a place they would ever go. In their view, America is New York city and Washington, D.C., and it is the elites and the rich and the powerful.\nI think the values of Indiana are the values of America. And it gives me great comfort that this primary is going to be decided by the Midwestern common sense of the Hoosier state. And I don't think they're interested in-- in some bully who yells and screams and doesn't have any real policy solutions.\nHANNITY: Let me do a follow-up.\nCRUZ: Yes.\nHANNITY: For Donald Trump to get to 1,237, for you now to get the nomination, you're going to need a second ballot in a contested convention. You both know that. You understand the rules.\nCRUZ: Sure.\nHANNITY: You're fighting hard. This is the process. Everybody knew the process going in. 243 is Donald Trump's number to get to 1,237. So my question is -- and I think a lot of people don't understand it.\nDo you all understand how this works?\nAUDIENCE: Yes!\nHANNITY: All right. But there probably are some people here that don't. But for those who don't, explain what the rules are, how the process goes so they will -- so people that don't know understand.\nCRUZ: Let me note one thing, that the numbers that are being reported by some of the media outlets...\nHANNITY: This is the AP (INAUDIBLE)\nCRUZ: OK, and the AP's numbers are bogus because what they've done is they've given all of the unbound delegates in Pennsylvania to Donald Trump. Those delegates are not his. That's just reporters who want to run up his total. If you actually look at the bound delegates, Donald has about 50 fewer...\n(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)\nHANNITY: They're unbound on your side, too.\nCRUZ: They're unbound, so the media doesn't get to assume that every unbound delegate is...\n(CROSSTALK)\nHANNITY: I understand. I'm not going to argue.\nCRUZ: But here's the simple reality. I believe nobody is going to get to 1,237. Donald Trump is not going to get to 1,237. Nobody is before Cleveland.\n(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)\nCRUZ: So what's going to happen is simple. We're going to go into Cleveland. I'm going to have a ton of delegates. Donald Trump is going to have a ton of delegates. And then Cleveland, we're going to have a contested convention, and the battle is to see who can earn the support of a majority of the delegates elected by the people.\nAnd the reason that Donald is so desperately trying to get his media acolytes to say This is over, this is over, this is over, is because Donald cannot earn the support of a majority. He wants to change the rules so you don't need a majority.\nListen, if you can't get a support of the majority of delegates, you can't unite this party and you can't win in November!\n(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)\nHANNITY: Let me follow-up on this because this is really important.\n(CROSSTALK)\nFIORINA: Can I use a really simple analogy? Let me just use a really simple analogy...\nHANNITY: Go ahead.\nFIORINA: ... because last night was the NFL draft pick, right? And the Indianapolis Colts did pretty well. And here -- you know, in football, the 30-yard line ain't a touchdown.\n(LAUGHTER)\n(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)\nFIORINA: The 20-yard line ain't a touchdown. The 5-yard line ain't a touchdown. 1,237 delegates is what it takes to get a touchdown, and this guy's going to get it.\n(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)\nHANNITY: Let me -- you know, I was thinking about this coming in because I remember, early on in the process, you, for example, and Donald Trump -- you guys got along. If you go to social media today, it is Cruz people hate Trump people, Trump people hate Cruz people. And I...\n(BOOS)\nHANNITY: Well...\nFIORINA: There you go.\nHANNITY: I'm saying -- you got to read social media. I'm reading it every day. But here's my point. Carly Fiorina was kind of tough on Ted Cruz, and you guys are here united today. So the bigger, broader question is, there's going to be one nominee. It's either going to be you or it's going to be Donald Trump.\nI believe if the party is divided, it cannot win and defeat Hillary Clinton. Do you think, for example -- you were pretty tough on him. You were pretty tough on everybody, Carly. Do you think at the end of the day, in spite of differences and a hard-run campaign on all sides, that the Republican Party unites on this mission never Hillary? And how does that happen?\nCRUZ: It absolutely...\nFIORINA: It will happen if he's our nominee.\n(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)\nFIORINA: It will happen if he's our nominee.\nCRUZ: And that's an important distinction. Listen, Sean, you are absolutely right. We have got to unify the party. If we don't unify the party, we lose.\nAnd you know, you mentioned animosity. Listen, I love the Trump supporters. Many of the Trump supporters have supported me at some point. They are wonderful people who are scared for the direction of this country, who are upset at the corruption of Washington, who are upset at illegal immigration and the lies coming from Washington of people saying that they're going to stop it, and they're upset at seeing jobs going overseas over and over and over again. They're fed up.\nAnd I love the Trump supporters. I am working hard to earn the support of every one of them.\n(APPLAUSE)\nCRUZ: And I also think the Trump supporters -- they're being lied to right now.\n(CHEERS)\nCRUZ: Donald Trump is playing a confidence game. It's like three-card Monte. He is pretending -- listen, this is John Boehner -- John Boehner's golfing and texting buddy. This is someone who contributed seven times to Hillary Clinton, including twice to her presidential campaign.\nNow, can you imagine, Sean, ever being so fevered that you wake up one morning and say, I need to write a check to Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign?\n(APPLAUSE)\nCRUZ: Donald Trump has done that twice. And listen, one of the keys of uniting the party -- listen, Donald is relentlessly personal and nasty and negative, and all he knows how to do is curse and insult. I don't respond in kind. You haven't heard me insulting him personally. I'll talk about policy differences. He thinks Planned Parenthood is wonderful. He agrees with Hillary Clinton on that.\n(BOOS)\nCRUZ: I intend to instruct the Department of Justice to open an investigation into Planned Parenthood.\n(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)\nCRUZ: Now, that's a policy difference, but it's...\nHANNITY: Hold on. I have one more question on unity when we get back, and then we're going to turn it over to this great audience.\nWe have more with 2016 presidential candidate Texas senator Ted Cruz, his running mate, Carly Fiorina.\n(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)\nHANNITY: Members of the audience -- they're coming up, as well, as \"Hannity\" on the road continues.\n Welcome back to \"Hannity,\" as we come to you live tonight from Indianapolis, Indiana. We have Senator Ted Cruz, his running mate, Carly Fiorina, for the entire hour.\nWe were talking about unity at the end of the last segment. Maybe I have a crazy idea. I've been talking about it on radio now for the last two weeks. and that is, I look at, from the original 17 people that were running for office -- and I look at the unity you now have made with Carly Fiorina. I like it. I think it's really healthy.\nAnd then I think, OK, John Kasich and Marco Rubio and Governor Rick Perry, Bobby Jindal, we have people outside of government like Rudy Giuliani or Newt Gingrich, Nikki Haley -- we have some real, real rock stars, people that have had great records.\nOne of the things I would hope is that America might be able to see what a potential Republican administration might look like to help solve the problems we have, because our bench is so much deeper. As a conservative who will vote Republican, I want to use those stars because I think our problems need the best and brightest. Do you think that's a possibility?\nCRUZ: Absolutely, yes. I'll tell you, it was one of the reasons why I announced Carly as my running mate this week is to illustrate, to show the voters you have a clear choice. This is what the administration will look like. It will be populated by leaders, by principled leaders.\nYou know, you look at the men and women that stood on that debate stage. It was amazingly talented and diverse and dynamic. You know, Abraham Lincoln assembled a team of rivals. And, you know, there's the old principle in management that A's hire A's and B's hire C's. If you're weak and insecure that you want to surround yourself by weak people -- you know, I don't know if you saw Donald Trump advising teenagers saying surround yourself by people who are incompetent, it will make you look good.\n(LAUGHTER)\nCRUZ: That is the worst advice you can possibly give young people.\n(APPLAUSE)\nCRUZ: And I'll tell you what, here's what I'll tell young people. Surround yourself by people who are smarter than you, who know more than you, who are amazing at executing, bring together a team of stars behind a shared vision, a shared policy goal, and then we can work together to bring back jobs in this country, to defend the constitution, defend our freedom and to keep us safe. That's what I intend to do as president.\n(APPLAUSE)\nHANNITY: Carly, I want you to weigh in on this.\n(APPLAUSE)\nFIORINA: You know, it matters who our nominee is. It matters.\n(APPLAUSE)\nFIORINA: You don't just get to slap an \"R\" on your jersey and say I'm a Republican. How long, how long have we as conservative and Republicans said we actually need a real conservative? We need someone who will offer a real contrast.\n(APPLAUSE)\nFIORINA: So what you heard was leadership 101. But let me say something.\nHANNITY: You were a CEO.\nFIORINA: That's right. That's how you -- that's how a leader leads. But this is not just a fight for the future of our nation, and it is. It is also a fight for the soul of our party.\n(APPLAUSE)\nFIORINA: Do we believe in values, in principles, in policies, or do we not? This is a fight worth having, and I am proud to stand next to this man, the man I believe must be our nominee, a great leader, and fight for the soul of our party and the future of our nation.\n(APPLAUSE)\nHANNITY: When you factor in radical Islam, there is a huge clash of cultures. It's also a clash for civilization itself, because there are people that are scheming and plotting and planning and hoping and praying and believe that if they strap bombs on their own children that -- and kill innocent men, women, and children, that Allah will reward them with 72 virgins. That is also a major threat I hope everybody would unite behind.\nFIORINA: Absolutely.\nHANNITY: Right?\nFIORINA: By the way, that is part of the fight for the future of our nation. Jobs are at stake. Our liberties are at stake. And I don't want to be worried about who someone's going to nominate to the Supreme Court. I'm not going to worry with President Ted Cruz.\n(APPLAUSE)\nFIORINA: And, yes, our leadership in the world, which is vital to our security here at home, is at stake. There is no doubt.\nBut if I may, this guy doesn't need a Washington lobbyist to write a foreign policy speech for him that he can give behind a teleprompter. This guy knows what he believes, and he knows what his policies are, and he knows what it takes to keep us safe.\n(APPLAUSE)\nHANNITY: All right, we have some good news. The question and answer period by me is now over. And we're going to turn it over to this great audience. We are in Indianapolis with Senator Ted Cruz, his vice presidential running mate, Carly Fiorina. \"Hannity\" on the road live from Indiana, the audience questions; they're coming up straight ahead as we continue.\n(APPLAUSE)\nHANNITY: Welcome back to \"Hannity\" as we continue now with Senator Ted Cruz and vice presidential running mate Carly Fiorina.\n(APPLAUSE)\nHANNITY: We're going to turn it over to the great people in Indianapolis. And, ma'am, thank you for being with us. What's your name?\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Good evening. My name is Sharon Enright (ph) and I'm from the beautiful little town of Centerville, Indiana, on the eastern side of the state.\n(APPLAUSE)\nHANNITY: Thank you. Your question?\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: About three weeks ago, my husband asked me, who do you want to see as it Ted's running mate? I quickly responded, Carly.\n(APPLAUSE)\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: So you're our dream team, and congratulations on such a strong team that you're going to make.\nCRUZ: Thank you.\nHANNITY: When did you know -- do you have a question?\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: No.\nHANNITY: No, OK. I thought --\n(LAUGHTER)\nCRUZ: Thank you very much.\nHANNITY: When did you know -- because it was a little unconventional. I didn't think the John Kasich thing worked out too well, but, you know, but this was unconventional but it's gotten a very positive response. When did you decide?\nCRUZ: Well, listen, it was a long and systemic process. And any serious candidate for president, I mean, you have to -- we're less than 100 days from the convention. You have to be vetting someone who's prepared to step in and do the job. We started with initial list of over 40 people we were looking at. And then we culled that down to 17.\nHANNITY: How?\nCRUZ: We began vetting those 17 based on public records. We cut that down to a list of five. And I tell you, the final choice I found was very, very easy, because for me I was looking for someone with knowledge who understood how to bring jobs back to this country, where jobs come from, that they don't come from Washington. They come from small business. They come from reducing the burdens of Washington on small business.\n(APPLAUSE)\nCRUZ: But I was also looking for someone with judgment, someone who's not going to be rash, not going to be hot headed, not going to go off on the latest Twitter storm and do who knows what, but someone who will be levelheaded, someone who will have the maturity, as you were bringing up earlier, to assemble a team, a team of rivals, of strong leaders, of extraordinary principled leaders.\nAnd finally someone with character. And I think character is the most important aspect. You need someone who tells the truth, who is honest and--\n(APPLAUSE)\nCRUZ: And there are a great many things I respect about Carly. One is her journey from a secretary to being CEO of the largest technology company in the world, to being the first female CEO of a Fortune 20 company. And --\n(APPLAUSE)\nHANNITY: That is an amazing story. It really is.\nCRUZ: And it's not easy for women fighting in the professional world. Listen, my mom was a pioneer computer programmer in the 1950s. My wife, Heidi, spent two decades in the business world. And I have seen the garbage women put up with in the workplace.\nAnd one of the things I admire about Carly is she stands up to bullies. Bullies want you to fold over and run away.\n(APPLAUSE)\nCRUZ: And Carly is not afraid of bullies. She's not afraid of Donald Trump. She's not afraid of Hillary Clinton. And she's not afraid of Vladimir Putin or the Ayatollah Khomeini. We need strong leaders who aren't afraid of bullies.\n(APPLAUSE)\nHANNITY: Let's go back to another -- hi. How are you? What's your name, sir?\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Senator Cruz, my name is Nick Phillips (ph). I'm a junior in college. Now, the Sanders' group, they released a statement saying they would give free college stuff. Now, as a high school student, I have to figure out how to pay for it and everything. So what are your thoughts on his statement, and how do you plan to combat it?\nCRUZ: Well, Nick, thank you for being here and thank you for --\n(APPLAUSE)\nCRUZ: Thank you for asking that question.\nListen, Bernie is attracting a lot of young people. He's exciting a lot of young people. And there are a number of things behind it. One is young people are fed up with what's going on right now. They're fed up with the corruption in Washington. They're fed up with the lying. And I will give Bernie credit. He is an honest socialist. He actually says what he believes.\n(LAUGHTER)\nCRUZ: Now, you know, the standard approach of socialists is to give away free stuff. That's what the Democrats have done a long time is give away free stuff. I'll tell you the simplest rule in economics is there ain't no such thing as a free lunch.\n(APPLAUSE)\nCRUZ: If you look at young people right now, if you sat down, tried to design an agenda to hammer the living daylights out of young people, it would harder to come up with a better agenda than the Obama/Clinton economy. Young people right now are coming out of school buried in student loans. I know what that's like. My parents went bankrupt. You're a junior in high school. When I was a junior and senior in high school, my parents went bankrupt.\nSo when I went to college I had two jobs to help pay my way through. I came out of school with about $100,000 in school loans. I had a mortgage but I didn't have a house.\n(LAUGHTER)\nCRUZ: I get exactly what that's like and young people are uneasy, but right now they're coming out of school, they can't find jobs. The problem with Bernie, you give everyone free college. OK, fine, how do you pay for that? You pay for that by jacking up taxing on small businesses across the country, which will mean you'll be young, you'll get free college, and you'll have even fewer job opportunities than you have now.\n(APPLAUSE)\nCRUZ: So the answer that I want to see for young people is we're going to reduce the regulations, we're going to repeal Obamacare, we're going to pass a flat tax, we're going to reduce the burdens on small businesses so that, Nick, when you come out of college, you're going to experience something that has been the case for most of the history of America except the last seven years. You're going to come out of school and you're going to have two or three or even four or five job offers. You're going to call your parents and say, mom, you can't believe it, I can do this or I can do this or I can do this, what direction do I want to go? That's the best answer for young people, is lift the burdens on small businesses so the economy explodes so you have a bright future. That's what this election's all about.\n(APPLAUSE)\nHANNITY: Thank you very much. It would be nice if kids graduated college and don't have to move back home with mom and dad in their basement. We'll take a break. We'll come back. More questions from the audience as we continue with Texas Senator Ted Cruz, his running mate Carly Fiorina. HANNITY on the road in Indianapolis, Indiana, will continue.\n Welcome back to \"Hannity\" as we continue for the entire hour. We're in Indianapolis, Indiana with Senator Ted Cruz and Carly Fiorina. Dan we have a wonderful --\n(APPLAUSE)\nHANNITY: Hi.\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Hello.\nHANNITY: How are you?\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Just fine.\nHANNITY: Thank you for joining us. What's your name?\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: My name is Cindy Awad (ph).\nHANNITY: And your question?\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I'm from Brownsburg, Indiana.\n(APPLAUSE)\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: And I'm originally from Texas, so my heart is with you in Texas. I've already voted for you in the early primary voting.\n(APPLAUSE)\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: It's a pleasure to speak with you. And my question is, what will you do on your first day in office as president?\nCRUZ: Cindy, thank you for that question. I've pledged to do five things on the first day in office. The first thing I intend to do in office is to rescind every single illegal and unconstitutional executive action that Barack Obama made.\n(APPLAUSE)\nCRUZ: We're a nation of rule of law and we need to follow the laws.\nThe second thing I intend to do is instruct the Department of Justice to open an investigation into Planned Parenthood and to prosecute any and all criminal violations.\n(APPLAUSE)\nCRUZ: The third thing I intend to do on the first day is instruct every federal agency in the federal government the persecution of religious liberty ends that day.\n(APPLAUSE)\nCRUZ: The fourth thing I intend to do is rip to shreds this catastrophic Iranian nuclear deal.\n(APPLAUSE)\nCRUZ: And the fifth thing I intend to do is begin the process of moving the American embassy in Israel to Jerusalem, the once and eternal capital.\n(APPLAUSE)\nCRUZ: And I'll tell you, Cindy, in the days that follow, I'm going to instruct the department of education that Common Core ends today.\n(APPLAUSE)\nHANNITY: We have about 30 seconds left. Vice presidents take on different roles in administrations. If you become the president, how big a role will Carly have?\nCRUZ: Carly will have an integral role. And I'll tell you, that was a big part of our conversation. When I talked to Carly, one of the things she said is she said I'm not good at going to funerals, I'm not good at cutting ribbons.\n(LAUGHTER)\nCRUZ: And I said who in their right mind would want a vice president who is anything other than an active and engaged partner helping to lead the effort to turn the country around, and I am looking forward to working hand in hand with Carly to make that happen.\nHANNITY: We've got to take a break. But we're going to have more \"Hannity\" coming up as we continue from beautiful Indianapolis, Indiana. \"Hannity\" on the road continues straight ahead.\n Welcome back to \"Hannity.\" Unfortunately that is all the time we have left. I want to say thank you to Senator Cruz, thank you to Carly Fiorina. Give them a big hand. Thank you.\n(APPLAUSE)\nHANNITY: We're out of time for tonight. Thanks to all of you for being with us. Have a great weekend. We'll see you back here Monday.\nEND\n ",

        "title": "Worcester may sue state over mistake in school aid \nMA_Worcester_Telegram WORCESTER – City and school officials are exploring their options – including possibly litigation – to get the state to fix a mistake they said it made in its inflation calculations six years ago, which would net Worcester an extra $12 million in education aid next year.\nAt a joint meeting on Monday, members of the School Committee and City Council agreed to seek the city law office’s advice on whether a statute of limitations would apply in any legal attempt to recoup that money. The School Committee agreed to accept the report of that meeting and the recommendation at its meeting on Thursday night. Councilor-At-Large Morris Bergman, who attended Monday’s meeting, said the request would go before the City Council at its meeting next Tuesday.\nAt the heart of the district’s case is a discrepancy in the state’s inflation factor setting procedure that originated in the latter half of 2010. Brian Allen, the schools’ chief financial and operations officer, said the state should have set the inflation rate at about 6.7 percent at the time.\n“That’s when the economy was going in the tank,” he said. “So the state said, ‘Yikes.’”\nState officials ended up skipping that quarter entirely, and at the end of the year set the inflation factor at around 3 percent, according to Mr. Allen. Since the inflation factor is based on previous inflation rates, that 3.7 percent difference has persisted across the last six years, resulting in incorrectly low rates, Worcester officials say.\nThe city schools would substantially benefit from the corrected higher inflation factor this year, as the district faces a projected $21 million shortfall in its fiscal 2017 budget – a gap that was exacerbated by a rare negative inflation factor this year. The inflation rate is one of two major elements, along with student enrollment, that determine the state’s aid amount to local districts each year, Mr. Allen said. Restoring the skipped 2010 quarter would amount to an extra $12 million in Worcester’s chapter 70 funding, he estimated.\nA month ago, he pleaded Worcester’s case to dozens of lawmakers at the Statehouse. “There was some interest” from the people there in the inflation factor issue, he said, but it amounted to nothing in the House budget, which excluded the inflation factor adjustment, as well as every other change to the state’s school funding formula that was proposed by a legislative task force last year.\n“We’ve been trying to get that mistake changed” for years, said Glenn Koocher, executive director of the Massachusetts Association of School Committees.\nThe current inflation factor is ultimately inaccurate, he added, considering the increase in prices public schools in the state still have to pay for services and goods.\nLike Mr. Allen, he considers the skipped quarter in 2010 a “technical issue” that could be fixed simply by adjusting the current inflation factor to include the excluded percentage from 2010. But it’s been a hard sell to state officials, especially this year, where there isn’t much room in the budget for the roughly $160 million that adjustment would cost the state.\n“Worcester’s the first (city raising the issue) that’s come to my attention,” Mr. Koocher said, who added the city in general “does a much better job at tracking money than most districts do.”\nMr. Bergman, however, said he was “shocked” to learn about the problem for the first time at Monday’s meeting.\n“I put my lawyer’s cap on – there’s usually a six-year statute of limitations in breach of contract situations,” he said, although he added he wasn’t sure exactly what could be done in the specific case of the state's inflation factor.\n“Moe raised the question – can we at least ask the law department (for the city)?” said School Committee member Jack Foley, who also was at Monday’s meeting.\nMr. Foley added he could see Worcester trying to bring other towns and cities adversely affected by the inflation factor into its effort to raise the issue with the state – “we’d certainly have better standing,” he said.\nWhile he didn’t have much hope in a legal action being effective, Mr. Koocher also believes Worcester’s attempt to highlight the problem can only help.\n“Anything you can throw out in the public discourse during budget season raises awareness,” he said, adding he is still hopeful the state Senate, which has yet to release its recommended budget for next year, will incorporate the inflation factor fix, as well as other funding formula changes, into its spending plan.\nScott O’Connell can be reached at Scott.O’Connell@telegram.com.

But it’s been a hard sell to state officials, especially this year, where there isn’t much room in the budget for the roughly $160 million that adjustment would cost the state.\n“Worcester’s the first (city raising the issue) that’s come to my attention,” Mr. Koocher said, who added the city in general “does a much better job at tracking money than most districts do.”\nMr. Bergman, however, said he was “shocked” to learn about the problem for the first time at Monday’s meeting.\n“I put my lawyer’s cap on – there’s usually a six-year statute of limitations in breach of contract situations,” he said, although he added he wasn’t sure exactly what could be done in the specific case of the state's inflation factor.\n“Moe raised the question – can we at least ask the law department (for the city)?” said School Committee member Jack Foley, who also was at Monday’s meeting.\nMr. Foley added he could see Worcester trying to bring other towns and cities adversely affected by the inflation factor into its effort to raise the issue with the state – “we’d certainly have better standing,” he said.\nWhile he didn’t have much hope in a legal action being effective, Mr. Koocher also believes Worcester’s attempt to highlight the problem can only help.\n“Anything you can throw out in the public discourse during budget season raises awareness,” he said, adding he is still hopeful the state Senate, which has yet to release its recommended budget for next year, will incorporate the inflation factor fix, as well as other funding formula changes, into its spending plan.\nScott O’Connell can be reached at Scott.O’Connell@telegram.com.

      "title": "Worcester may sue state over mistake in school aid \nMA_Worcester_Telegram WORCESTER – City and school officials are exploring their options – including possibly litigation – to get the state to fix a mistake they said it made in its inflation calculations six years ago, which would net Worcester an extra $12 million in education aid next year.\nAt a joint meeting on Monday, members of the School Committee and City Council agreed to seek the city law office’s advice on whether a statute of limitations would apply in any legal attempt to recoup that money. The School Committee agreed to accept the report of that meeting and the recommendation at its meeting on Thursday night. Councilor-At-Large Morris Bergman, who attended Monday’s meeting, said the request would go before the City Council at its meeting next Tuesday.\nAt the heart of the district’s case is a discrepancy in the state’s inflation factor setting procedure that originated in the latter half of 2010. Brian Allen, the schools’ chief financial and operations officer, said the state should have set the inflation rate at about 6.7 percent at the time.\n“That’s when the economy was going in the tank,” he said. “So the state said, ‘Yikes.’”\nState officials ended up skipping that quarter entirely, and at the end of the year set the inflation factor at around 3 percent, according to Mr. Allen. Since the inflation factor is based on previous inflation rates, that 3.7 percent difference has persisted across the last six years, resulting in incorrectly low rates, Worcester officials say.\nThe city schools would substantially benefit from the corrected higher inflation factor this year, as the district faces a projected $21 million shortfall in its fiscal 2017 budget – a gap that was exacerbated by a rare negative inflation factor this year. The inflation rate is one of two major elements, along with student enrollment, that determine the state’s aid amount to local districts each year, Mr. Allen said.
