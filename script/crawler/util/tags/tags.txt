 First time large clean up, it's a 3 bedroom 2 1/ bath house, but one BR will not be included in cleaning at-least at first, and another bedroom with only limited requirements. The main house and getting control of the laundry is vital. *no ironing*. Then simply help keep it clean especially with my grand kids living on the property, organize and pack as we ready to sell. We have animals, so there is the occasional small accident, but they are toy dogs inside so nothing major. The house once ready must be in showing condition at all times, so I need a self starter who is meticulous especially with those small things like base boards, doors faucets and walls etc. We have had someone hospitalized many times over past 5 years and he is still bedridden so the house get's way out of control even with the help we have for him. We have no carpet, only wood, tile, and wood vinyl we have some products but welcome yours though we are scent sensitive. After the one time (which would require a minimum of 4 to 6 hours, a second day may be needed to do all that's needed) we could sit and talk about a more regular arrangement if agreeable to all. We would want weekly or bi-weekly. And perhaps some agreed upon extra days for packing if possible. I am hoping to get started as soon as possible, so I look forward to any responses of good hard workers.
